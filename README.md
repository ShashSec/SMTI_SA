# Social Media threat intel

# Problem statement
Any Bussiness has several IT components that can be compromised directly or indirectly.
Any cyber threats on company's infratructure or its product is considered as direct attack and
any third party tools/service, software and hardware threats or vulnerability is considered as Indirect attack.
Also, Indirect attack can occur by cyber threats associated with vendor, contractors.

Direct attack on infrastructure causes huge impact due to data breach, Trade secret, finacial loss, etc.
Direct attack on products affects the revenue, market, etc.

Usually, Bussiness IT Infrastructure is monitored by the company and any breach in the infrastructure should be
identified by the company itself.

The vulnerabilty or compromise of any proucts either identified by the internal security testing team or
open source security researchers independent of the company. Though, most of the researchers are expected to 
report it to the parent organization many times the bugs are notified through social media like twitter.

Indiect attack on company by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the tools, service, software, products from
third parties can not be directly controlled by the bussiness and should be prepared to identify the vulnerability 
and take nessary action to remediate or protect the infratructure from cyber attack but most of these information will 
not be directly available to the company. Security buletin, social media or news media will best source of the information. 
for example badrabbit ransomeware was first notified via twitter. 

Many companies have struggled a cyber security breach by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the third party tools. 
for example equifax fail to update the apache struts vulnerability and this was exploited in data breach
So, Social media is best source of threat intelligence for indirect threats to the infrastructure.
