      When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication from Spring Security 3.1 to 3.2.4 a malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service into authenticating a proxy ticket that was not associated.

      ** DISPUTED ** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Facebook app 14.0 and the Facebook Messenger app 10.0 for iOS allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted filename extension that is improperly handled during MIME sniffing of chat traffic.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, because the user must accept an interstitial warning before the HTML file content is rendered, and because the HTML content's origin is a sandbox domain.
      The Express web framework before 3.11 and 4.x before 4.5 for Node.js does not provide a charset field in HTTP Content-Type headers in 400 level responses, which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via characters in a non-standard encoding.

      net/ceph/auth_x.c in Ceph, as used in the Linux kernel before 3.16.3, does not properly consider the possibility of kmalloc failure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket.
      net/ceph/auth_x.c in Ceph, as used in the Linux kernel before 3.16.3, does not properly validate auth replies, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted data from the IP address of a Ceph Monitor.

      content/renderer/device_sensors/device_orientation_event_pump.cc in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict access to high-rate gyroscope data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain speech signals from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that listens for ondeviceorientation events, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1231.
      Huawei home gateways WS318 with software V100R001C01B022 and earlier versions are affected by the PIN offline brute force cracking vulnerability of the WPS protocol because the random number generator (RNG) used in the supplier's solution is not random enough. As a result, brute force cracking the PIN code is easier. After an attacker cracks the PIN, the attacker can access the Internet via the cracked device.
