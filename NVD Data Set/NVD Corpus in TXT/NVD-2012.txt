NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-4885.
      PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_main.c.
      As per: http://grokbase.com/t/php/php-internals/122ehfap93/about-cve-2012-0831-magic-quotes-gpc-remote-disable-vulnerability

      iconvdata/ibm930.c in GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.16 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a multibyte character value of "0xffff" to the iconv function when converting IBM930 encoded data to UTF-8.
      The sock_setsockopt function in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5.7 does not ensure that a keepalive action is associated with a stream socket, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging the ability to create a raw socket.
      Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in SpiceWorks 5.3.75941 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) syslocation, (2) syscontact, or (3) sysName configuration in snmpd.conf.  NOTE: this entry was SPLIT from CVE-2012-2956 per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types.

NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2012-5508 due to different vulnerability types (ADT2).
      Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the default content option in jquery.ui.tooltip.js in the Tooltip widget in jQuery UI before 1.10.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the title attribute, which is not properly handled in the autocomplete combo box demo.
      Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in phpMoneyBooks 1.0.4 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-1669. NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.  NOTE: this issue might have been fixed in 1.0.3.

      The netlink_sendmsg function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5.5 does not validate the dst_pid field, which allows local users to have an unspecified impact by spoofing Netlink messages.
      Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the admin panel in osCMax before 2.5.1 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that conduct SQL injection attacks via the (1) status parameter to admin/stats_monthly_sales.php or (2) country parameter in a process action to admin/create_account_process.php.
      Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in js/wp-seo-metabox.js in the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin before 2.2 for WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the post_title parameter to wp-admin/post-new.php, which is not properly handled in the snippet preview functionality.
      GE Healthcare Centricity PACS 4.0 Server has a default password of (1) nasro for the nasro (ReadOnly) user and (2) nasrw for the nasrw (Read/Write) user, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.
      GE Healthcare Centricity PACS Workstation 4.0 and 4.0.1, and Server 4.0, has a password of 2charGE for the geservice account, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors related to TimbuktuPro.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this password is default, hardcoded, or dependent on another system or product that requires it.
      GE Healthcare Centricity PACS Workstation 4.0 and 4.0.1 has a password of ddpadmin for the ddpadmin user, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this password is default, hardcoded, or dependent on another system or product that requires a fixed value.
      inspircd in Debian before 2.0.7 does not properly handle unsigned integers.  NOTE: This vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix to CVE-2012-1836.
      InspIRCd before 2.0.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).
      The decode_search function in dhcp.c in dhcpcd 3.x allows remote DHCP servers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted response.
      The decode_search function in dhcp.c in dhcpcd 3.x allows remote DHCP servers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted response.
      The decode_search function in dhcp.c in dhcpcd 3.x does not properly free allocated memory, which allows remote DHCP servers to cause a denial of service via a crafted response.
      Integer overflow in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large AIO iovec.
      <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html">CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound</a>
      Expat, when used in a parser that has not called XML_SetHashSalt or passed it a seed of 0, makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via vectors involving use of the srand function.
      Integer overflow in the snd_compr_allocate_buffer function in sound/core/compress_offload.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.6-rc6-next-20120917 allows local users to cause a denial of service (insufficient memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SNDRV_COMPRESS_SET_PARAMS ioctl call.
      <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html">CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound</a>
      The sock_setsockopt function in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5 mishandles negative values of sk_sndbuf and sk_rcvbuf, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for a crafted setsockopt system call with the (1) SO_SNDBUF or (2) SO_RCVBUF option.
      Cross Site Scripting (XSS) exists in Jamroom before 4.2.7 via the Status Update field.
      A VMSF_DELTA memory corruption was discovered in unrar before 5.5.5, as used in Sophos Anti-Virus Threat Detection Engine before 3.37.2 and other products, that can lead to arbitrary code execution. An integer overflow can be caused in DataSize+CurChannel. The result is a negative value of the "DestPos" variable, which allows the attacker to write out of bounds when setting Mem[DestPos].
      WordPress through 4.8.2 uses a weak MD5-based password hashing algorithm, which makes it easier for attackers to determine cleartext values by leveraging access to the hash values. NOTE: the approach to changing this may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.
