      The server implementation of the EAP-MSCHAPv2 protocol in the eap-mschapv2 plugin in strongSwan 4.2.12 through 5.x before 5.3.4 does not properly validate local state, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an empty Success message in response to an initial Challenge message.
      McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM), Enterprise Security Manager/Log Manager (ESMLM), and Enterprise Security Manager/Receiver (ESMREC) 9.3.x before 9.3.2MR19, 9.4.x before 9.4.2MR9, and 9.5.x before 9.5.0MR8, when configured to use Active Directory or LDAP authentication sources, allow remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with the username "NGCP|NGCP|NGCP;" and any password.
      driver/subprocs.c in XScreenSaver before 5.34 does not properly perform an internal consistency check, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the lock screen by hot swapping monitors.
      Heap-based buffer overflow in the verify_vbr_checksum function in exfatfsck in exfat-utils before 1.2.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted filesystem.
      Node.js 0.12.x before 0.12.9, 4.x before 4.2.3, and 5.x before 5.1.1 does not ensure the availability of a parser for each HTTP socket, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uncaughtException and service outage) via a pipelined HTTP request.
      Multiple buffer overflows in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer (VEV) allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) 3DM or (2) Flic Animation file.

      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange Guard before 2.2.0-rev8. The "getprivkeybyid" API call is used to download a PGP Private Key for a specific user after providing authentication credentials. Clients provide the "id" and "cid" parameter to specify the current user by its user- and context-ID. The "auth" parameter contains a hashed password string which gets created by the client by asking the user to enter his or her OX Guard password. This parameter is used as single point of authentication when accessing PGP Private Keys. In case a user has set the same password as another user, it is possible to download another user's PGP Private Key by iterating the "id" and "cid" parameters. This kind of attack would also be able by brute-forcing login credentials, but since the "id" and "cid" parameters are sequential they are much easier to predict than a user's login name. At the same time, there are some obvious insecure standard passwords that are widely used. A attacker could send the hashed representation of typically weak passwords and randomly fetch Private Key of matching accounts. The attack can be executed by both internal users and "guests" which use the external mail reader.

      An issue was discovered in PHP 5.x and 7.x, when the configuration uses apache2handler/mod_php or php-fpm with OpCache enabled. With 5.x after 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode ("opcode" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes. PHP scripts often contain sensitive information: Think of CMS configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means gaining privileges to the CMS database.
