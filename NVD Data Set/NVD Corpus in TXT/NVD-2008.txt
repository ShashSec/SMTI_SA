      Stack-based buffer overflow in the ODBC server service in Citect CitectSCADA 6 and 7, and CitectFacilities 7, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in the second application packet in a TCP session on port 20222.
      The vulnerability found in CitectSCADA could allow a remote un-authenticated attacker to force an abnormal termination of the vulnerable software (Denial of Service) or to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems to gain complete control of the software. The CitectSCADA and CitectFacilities applications include ODBC server capabilities to provide remote SQL access to a relational database. For that purpose, an ODBC Server component is used to service requests from clients on TCP/IP networks. Requests are serviced over a TCP high-port in which the application layer protocol reads an initial packet that specifies the length of data and then a second packet of data, of the same length is then read. Once the data is read from the network, it is then copied to an internal buffer of fixed size allocated in the stack without previously verifying that the buffer is big enough to store all the read data.
The vulnerability is related to a lack of a proper length-checking on data read from the network. A specially crafted combination of length and data packets could be used to exploit the vulnerability allowing an un-authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.
The bug is a texbook example of classic simple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities of the 1990s that can be exploited by overwriting the return address of the currently running thread.
Fixes and Workarounds:
User organizations should deploy the vendor patch, which is available upon request at http://www.citect.com/ or disable the vulnerable service (ODBC server) if it is not needed in their particular installation.
      The access complexity for this vulnerability is set at High due to the fact that exploiting this vulnerability requires the SCADA system to be connected to the internet and the client needs to be using ODBC technology.  SCADA systems are not typically installed to connect to the internet for security purposes.  While the vendor acknowledges that this vulnerability exists and will provide a patch upon request, they point out that this can be easily mitigated by ensuring SCADA systems (not limited to Citect products) are not connected to the internet.
      Citect will provide a patch upon request to mitigate this vulnerability.  Please see the following press release for more information:
http://www.citect.com/documents/news_and_media/pr-citect-address-security.pdf
For further information on properly securing SCADA systems, please see the following whitepaper published by Citect:

      The default configuration of the JBossAs component in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (aka JBossEAP or EAP), possibly 4.2 before CP04 and 4.3 before CP02, when a production environment is enabled, sets the DownloadServerClasses property to true, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (non-EJB classes) via a download request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3273.
      Multiple integer overflows in JasPer 1.900.1 might allow context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact via a crafted image file, related to integer multiplication for memory allocation.
      Race condition in the jas_stream_tmpfile function in libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (program exit) by creating the appropriate tmp.XXXXXXXXXX temporary file, which causes Jasper to exit.  NOTE: this was originally reported as a symlink issue, but this was incorrect.  NOTE: some vendors dispute the severity of this issue, but it satisfies CVE's requirements for inclusion.
      Buffer overflow in the jas_stream_printf function in libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 might allow context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact via vectors related to the mif_hdr_put function and use of vsprintf.

Microsoft Security Advisory (960906)
Vulnerability in WordPad Text Converter Could Allow Remote Code Execution
Published: December 9, 2008
Microsoft is investigating new reports of a vulnerability in the WordPad Text Converter for Word 97 files on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2. Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 are not affected as these operating systems do not contain the vulnerable code.
Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action to protect our customers, which may include providing a solution through a service pack, our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs.
At this time, we are aware only of limited and targeted attacks that attempt to use this vulnerability. Additionally, as the issue has not been publicly disclosed broadly, we believe the risk at this time to be limited.
We continue to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. We believe the commonly accepted practice of reporting vulnerabilities directly to a vendor serves everyone's best interests. This practice helps to ensure that customers receive comprehensive, high-quality updates for security vulnerabilities without exposure to malicious attackers while the update is being developed.
Customers who believe that they have been attacked can obtain security support at Get security support and should contact the national law enforcement agency in their country. Customers in the United States can contact Customer Service and Support at no charge using the PC Safety hotline at 1-866-PCSAFETY. Additionally, customers in the United States should contact their local FBI office or report their situation at Internet Crime Complaint Center.
Microsoft continues to encourage customers to follow the "Protect Your Computer" guidance of enabling a firewall, applying all software updates and installing anti-virus and anti-spyware software. Additional information can be found at Security at home.
Mitigating Factors:
•	
This issue does not affect Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.
•	
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
•	
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
•	
When Microsoft Office Word is installed, Word 97 documents are by default opened using Microsoft Office Word, which is not affected by this vulnerability. However, an attacker could rename a malicious file to have a Windows Write (.wri) extension, which would still invoke WordPad. This file type can be blocked at the Internet perimeter.

      xine-lib before 1.1.15 performs V4L video frame preallocation before ascertaining the required length, which has unknown impact and attack vectors, possibly related to a buffer overflow in the open_video_capture_device function in src/input/input_v4l.c.
      Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in xine-lib before 1.1.15 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors that send ID3 data to the (1) id3v22_interp_frame and (2) id3v24_interp_frame functions in src/demuxers/id3.c.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
      The real_parse_audio_specific_data function in demux_real.c in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, uses an untrusted height (aka codec_data_length) value as a divisor, which allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and crash) via a zero value.

      The layout engine in Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption via vectors related to (1) a reachable assertion or (2) an integer overflow.
      Per http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-60.html
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare memory for exploitation through some means other than JavaScript such as large images.
      The layout engine in Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors that trigger an assertion failure.

      Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy by causing the browser to issue an XMLHttpRequest to an attacker-controlled resource that uses a 302 redirect to a resource in a different domain, then reading content from the response, aka "response disclosure."
      Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 allow remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy and access portions of data from another domain via a JavaScript URL that redirects to the target resource, which generates an error if the target data does not have JavaScript syntax, which can be accessed using the window.onerror DOM API.
      Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 does not properly parse URLs with leading whitespace or control characters, which might allow remote attackers to misrepresent URLs and simplify phishing attacks.
      The CSS parser in Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 ignores the '\0' escaped null character, which might allow remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms such as sanitization routines.
      Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an XBL binding to an "unloaded document."
      Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.19, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.14 allow remote attackers to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges via unknown vectors in which "page content can pollute XPCNativeWrappers."
      Unspecified vulnerability in the session-restore feature in Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.5 and 2.x before 2.0.0.19 allows remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy, inject content into documents associated with other domains, and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via unknown vectors related to restoration of SessionStore data.
