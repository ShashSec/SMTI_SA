      ikiwiki 3.20161219 does not properly check if a revision changes the access permissions for a page on sites with the git and recentchanges plugins and the CGI interface enabled, which allows remote attackers to revert certain changes by leveraging permissions to change the page before the revision was made.
      Race condition in the XMPP library in Smack before 4.1.9, when the SecurityMode.required TLS setting has been set, allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass TLS protections and trigger use of cleartext for client authentication by stripping the "starttls" feature from a server response.
      The virgl_cmd_get_capset function in hw/display/virtio-gpu-3d.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with Virtio GPU Device emulator support allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and process crash) via a VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET command with a maximum capabilities size with a value of 0.
      The virtio_gpu_set_scanout function in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with Virtio GPU Device emulator support allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and process crash) via a scanout id in a VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_SET_SCANOUT command larger than num_scanouts.
      The _prolog_error function in slurmd/req.c in Slurm before 15.08.13, 16.x before 16.05.7, and 17.x before 17.02.0-pre4 has a vulnerability in how the slurmd daemon informs users of a Prolog failure on a compute node. That vulnerability could allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file on the system. Any exploitation of this is dependent on the user being able to cause or anticipate the failure (non-zero return code) of a Prolog script that their job would run on. This issue affects all Slurm versions from 0.6.0 (September 2005) to present. Workarounds to prevent exploitation of this are to either disable your Prolog script, or modify it such that it always returns 0 ("success") and adjust it to set the node as down using scontrol instead of relying on the slurmd to handle that automatically. If you do not have a Prolog set you are unaffected by this issue.
      ** DISPUTED ** WampServer 3.0.6 installs two services called 'wampapache' and 'wampmysqld' with weak file permissions, running with SYSTEM privileges. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. To properly exploit this vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file called mysqld.exe or httpd.exe and replace the original files. The next time the service starts, the malicious file will get executed as SYSTEM. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that a configuration in which "'someone' (an attacker) is able to replace files on a PC" is not "the fault of WampServer."
      The mailSend function in the isMail transport in PHPMailer before 5.2.18 might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code via a \" (backslash double quote) in a crafted Sender property.
      The setFrom function in the Sendmail adapter in the zend-mail component before 2.4.11, 2.5.x, 2.6.x, and 2.7.x before 2.7.2, and Zend Framework before 2.4.11 might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code via a \" (backslash double quote) in a crafted e-mail address.
      Directory traversal in /connectors/index.php in MODX Revolution before 2.5.2-pl allows remote attackers to perform local file inclusion/traversal/manipulation via a crafted id (aka dir) parameter, related to browser/directory/getlist.
      Directory traversal in /connectors/index.php in MODX Revolution before 2.5.2-pl allows remote attackers to perform local file inclusion/traversal/manipulation via a crafted dir parameter, related to browser/directory/remove.

      Stack-based buffer overflow in QXmlSimpleReader in Qt 4.8.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a xml file with multiple nested open tags.
      An issue was discovered in Sprecher Automation SPRECON-E Service Program before 3.43 SP0. Under certain preconditions, it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.
      Authorization Bypass in the Web interface of Arcadyan SLT-00 Star* (aka Swisscom Internet-Box) devices before R7.7 allows unauthorized reconfiguration of the static routing table via an unauthenticated HTTP request, leading to denial of service and information disclosure.
      An issue was discovered in Radisys MRF Web Panel (SWMS) 9.0.1. The MSM_MACRO_NAME POST parameter in /swms/ms.cgi was discovered to be vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It is possible to use the pipe character (|) to inject arbitrary OS commands and retrieve the output in the application's responses. Attackers could execute unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the software, or read, write, and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application or the application's owner (apache user).
      The aio_mount function in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel before 4.7.7 does not properly restrict execute access, which makes it easier for local users to bypass intended SELinux W^X policy restrictions, and consequently gain privileges, via an io_setup system call.
      The isMail transport in PHPMailer before 5.2.20 might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between the escapeshellarg function and internal escaping performed in the mail function in PHP. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2016-10033.

      ** DISPUTED ** WampServer 3.0.6 has two files called 'wampmanager.exe' and 'unins000.exe' with a weak ACL for Modify. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. To properly exploit this vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file called wampmanager.exe or unins000.exe and replace the original files. The next time one of these programs is launched by a more privileged user, malicious code chosen by the local attacker will run. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that a configuration in which "'someone' (an attacker) is able to replace files on a PC" is not "the fault of WampServer."

      An issue was discovered on LG devices using the MTK chipset with L(5.0/5.1), M(6.0/6.0.1), and N(7.0) software, and RCA Voyager Tablet, BLU Advance 5.0, and BLU R1 HD devices. The MTKLogger app with a package name of com.mediatek.mtklogger has application components that are accessible to any application that resides on the device. Namely, the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService application components are exported since they contain an intent filter, are not protected by a custom permission, and do not explicitly set the android:exported attribute to false. Therefore, these components are exported by default and are thus accessible to any third party application by using android.content.Intent object for communication. These application components can be used to start and stop the logs using Intent objects with embedded data. The available logs are the GPS log, modem log, network log, and mobile log. The base directory that contains the directories for the 4 types of logs is /sdcard/mtklog which makes them accessible to apps that require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. The GPS log contains the GPS coordinates of the user as well as a timestamp for the coordinates. The modem log contains AT commands and their parameters which allow the user's outgoing and incoming calls and text messages to be obtained. The network log is a tcpdump network capture. The mobile log contains the Android log, which is not available to third-party apps as of Android 4.1. The LG ID is LVE-SMP-160019.
      An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete files owned by the system user. The third-party app can modify the /data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications as they are received on the device. This also allows the /data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The third-party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files to obtain more privileges on the device.
      An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so.
      An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack.
      An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The two package names involved in the exfiltration are com.adups.fota and com.adups.fota.sysoper. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. Therefore, the app executing as the system user has been granted a number of powerful permissions even though they are not present in the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file. This app provides the com.adups.fota app access to the user's call log, text messages, and various device identifiers through the com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider component. The com.adups.fota app uses timestamps when it runs and is eligible to exfiltrate the user's PII every 72 hours. If 72 hours have passed since the value of the timestamp, then the exfiltration will be triggered by the user plugging in the device to charge or when they leave or enter a wireless network. The exfiltration occurs in the background without any user interaction.
      Untrusted search path vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.343 and 19.x through 21.x before 21.0.0.213 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.616 on Linux allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse resource in an unspecified directory.

      Information disclosure and authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Apache HTTP Server configuration bundled with ZoneMinder v1.30 and v1.29, which allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to browse all directories in the web root, e.g., a remote unauthenticated attacker can view all CCTV images on the server via the /events URI.
      An integer overflow vulnerability was observed in the regemit function in regexp.c in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before fa3d30fd18c348bb4b1f3858fb860f4fcd4b2045. The attack requires a regular expression with nested repetition. A successful exploitation of this issue can lead to code execution or a denial of service (buffer overflow) condition.
      An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.

      In FlexNet Publisher versions before Luton SP1 (11.14.1.1) running FlexNet Publisher Licensing Service on Windows platform, a boundary error related to a named pipe within the FlexNet Publisher Licensing Service can be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds memory read access and subsequently execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
      The racoon daemon in IPsec-Tools 0.8.2 contains a remotely exploitable computational-complexity attack when parsing and storing ISAKMP fragments. The implementation permits a remote attacker to exhaust computational resources on the remote endpoint by repeatedly sending ISAKMP fragment packets in a particular order such that the worst-case computational complexity is realized in the algorithm utilized to determine if reassembly of the fragments can take place.
      In PHP before 5.6.28 and 7.x before 7.0.13, incorrect handling of various URI components in the URL parser could be used by attackers to bypass hostname-specific URL checks, as demonstrated by evil.example.com:80#@good.example.com/ and evil.example.com:80?@good.example.com/ inputs to the parse_url function (implemented in the php_url_parse_ex function in ext/standard/url.c).
      Android 6.0 has an authentication bypass for attackers with root and physical access. Cryptographic authentication tokens (AuthTokens) used by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) are protected by a weak challenge. This allows adversaries to replay previously captured responses and use the TEE without authenticating. All apps using authentication-gated cryptography are vulnerable to this attack, which was confirmed on the LG Nexus 5X.

      An off-path attacker can cause a preemptible client association to be demobilized in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 by sending a crypto NAK packet to a victim client with a spoofed source address of an existing associated peer. This is true even if authentication is enabled.
      An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.
      A malicious authenticated peer can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection algorithm in ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPsec 3e160db8dc248a0bcb053b56a80167dc742d2b74 and a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 and modify a victim's clock.
      An exploitable vulnerability exists in the message authentication functionality of libntp in ntp 4.2.8p4 and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92. An attacker can send a series of crafted messages to attempt to recover the message digest key.
      ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p3 and NTPsec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 relies on the underlying operating system to protect it from requests that impersonate reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker.

      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27. The aria-label parameter of tiles at the Portal can be used to inject script code. Those labels use the name of the file (e.g. an image) which gets displayed at the portal application. Using script code at the file name leads to script execution. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). Users actively need to add a file to the portal to enable this attack. In case of shared files however, a internal attacker may modify a previously embedded file to carry a malicious file name. Furthermore this vulnerability can be used to persistently execute code that got injected by a temporary script execution vulnerability.

      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. The content sanitizer component has an issue with filtering malicious content in case invalid HTML code is provided. In such cases the filter will output a unsanitized representation of the content. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). Attackers can use this issue for filter evasion to inject script code later on.
      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev10. App Suite frontend offers to control whether a user wants to store cookies that exceed the session duration. This functionality is useful when logging in from clients with reduced privileges or shared environments. However the setting was incorrectly recognized and cookies were stored regardless of this setting when the login was performed using a non-interactive login method. In case the setting was enforced by middleware configuration or the user went through the interactive login page, the workflow was correct. Cookies with authentication information may become available to other users on shared environments. In case the user did not properly log out from the session, third parties with access to the same client can access a user's account.
      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.0-rev8. OX Guard uses an authentication token to identify and transfer guest users' credentials.  The OX Guard API acts as a padding oracle by responding with different error codes depending on whether the provided token matches the encryption padding.  In combination with AES-CBC, this allows attackers to guess the correct padding.  Attackers may run brute-forcing attacks on the content of the guest authentication token and discover user credentials.  For a practical attack vector, the guest users needs to have logged in, the content of the guest user's "OxReaderID" cookie and the value of the "auth" parameter needs to be known to the attacker.

      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. Script code can be embedded to RSS feeds using a URL notation. In case a user clicks the corresponding link at the RSS reader of App Suite, code gets executed at the context of the user. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). The attacker needs to reside within the same context to make this attack work.
      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. The API to configure external mail accounts can be abused to map and access network components within the trust boundary of the operator. Users can inject arbitrary hosts and ports to API calls. Depending on the response type, content and latency, information about existence of hosts and services can be gathered. Attackers can get internal configuration information about the infrastructure of an operator to prepare subsequent attacks.
      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev8. References to external Open XML document type definitions (.dtd resources) can be placed within .docx and .xslx files. Those resources were requested when parsing certain parts of the generated document. As a result an attacker can track access to a manipulated document. Usage of a document may get tracked and information about internal infrastructure may get exposed.
      An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. Custom messages can be shown at the login screen to notify external users about issues with sharing links. This mechanism can be abused to inject arbitrary text messages. Users may get tricked to follow instructions injected by third parties as part of social engineering attacks.

      When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for a block of data within the file. When calculating this length, the application will use a value from the file and add a constant to it without checking whether the addition of the constant will cause the integer to overflow which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into it. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.
      When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a field from the structure in an operation that can cause the integer to overflow. This result is then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due to the lack of bounds checking on the integer, the allocated memory buffer can be made to be undersized at which point the reading of file data will write outside the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
      When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a static size to allocate a heap buffer yet explicitly trust a size from the file when modifying data inside of it. Due to this, an aggressor can corrupt memory outside the bounds of this buffer which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
      Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the (1) CBookBase::SetDefTableStyle and (2) CBookBase::SetDefPivotStyle functions in Hancom Office 2014 VP allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) file.
      When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a property record within the Workbook stream, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for an element using a length from the file. When copying user-supplied data to this buffer, however, the application will use a different size which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.
      When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a particular record within the Workbook stream, an index miscalculation leading to a heap overlow can be made to occur in Hancom Office 2014. The vulnerability occurs when processing data for a formula used to render a chart via the HncChartPlugin.hplg library. Due to a lack of bounds-checking when incrementing an index that is used for writing into a buffer for formulae, the application can be made to write pointer data outside its bounds which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
      When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a record that uses the CSSValFormat object, Hancom Office 2014 will search for an underscore ("_") character at the end of the string and write a null terminator after it. If the character is at the very end of the string, the application will mistakenly write the null-byte outside the bounds of its destination. This can result in heap corruption that can lead code execution under the context of the application
      When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating this length, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into the object containing this structure. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.

      By flooding a Juniper Networks router running Junos OS with specially crafted IPv6 traffic, all available resources can be consumed, leading to the inability to store next hop information for legitimate traffic. In extreme cases, the crafted IPv6 traffic may result in a total resource exhaustion and kernel panic. The issue is triggered by traffic destined to the router. Transit traffic does not trigger the vulnerability. This issue only affects devices with IPv6 enabled and configured. Devices not configured to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue was found during internal product security testing. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 11.4 prior to 11.4R13-S3; 12.3 prior to 12.3R3-S4; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D30; 13.3 prior to 13.3R10, 13.3R4-S11; 14.1 prior to 14.1R2-S8, 14.1R4-S12, 14.1R8; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D28, 14.1X53-D40; 14.1X55 prior to 14.1X55-D35; 14.2 prior to 14.2R3-S10, 14.2R4-S7, 14.2R6; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S5, 15.1F5-S2, 15.1F6, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D70.
      Certain combinations of Junos OS CLI commands and arguments have been found to be exploitable in a way that can allow unauthorized access to the operating system. This may allow any user with permissions to run these CLI commands the ability to achieve elevated privileges and gain complete control of the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 11.4 prior to 11.4R13-S3; 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D60; 12.1X47 prior to 12.1X47-D45; 12.3 prior to 12.3R12; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D35; 13.2 prior to 13.2R9; 13.3 prior to 13.3R4-S11, 13.3R9; 14.1 prior to 14.1R4-S12, 14.1R7; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D28, 14.1X53-D40; 14.1X55 prior to 14.1X55-D35; 14.2 prior to 14.2R3-S10, 14.2R4-S7, 14.2R5; 15.1 prior to 15.1F4, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D60; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D70.

      A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.
      A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK library between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack, specifically a so-called "HPACK Bomb" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.

      ** DISPUTED ** The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevention of cluster joins) via a long sequence of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this sequence is not "removing the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability."
      Sophos EAS Proxy before 6.2.0 for Sophos Mobile Control, when Lotus Traveler is enabled, allows remote attackers to access arbitrary web-resources from the backend mail system via a request for the resource, aka an Open Reverse Proxy vulnerability.

      In the XSS Protection API module before 1.0.12 in Apache Sling, the method XSS.getValidXML() uses an insecure SAX parser to validate the input string, which allows for XXE attacks in all scripts which use this method to validate user input, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive data on the filesystem, perform same-site-request-forgery (SSRF), port-scanning behind the firewall or DoS the application.
      Product: Apache Cordova Android 5.2.2 and earlier. The application calls methods of the Log class. Messages passed to these methods (Log.v(), Log.d(), Log.i(), Log.w(), and Log.e()) are stored in a series of circular buffers on the device. By default, a maximum of four 16 KB rotated logs are kept in addition to the current log. The logged data can be read using Logcat on the device. When using platforms prior to Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), the log data is not sandboxed per application; any application installed on the device has the capability to read data logged by other applications.
      The default configuration of the OFBiz framework offers a blog functionality. Different users are able to operate blogs which are related to specific parties. In the form field for the creation of new blog articles the user input of the summary field as well as the article field is not properly sanitized. It is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code in these form fields. This code gets executed from the browser of every user who is visiting this article. Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache OFBiz 16.11.01.
      Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the CSRF content-type check in Jackrabbit-Webdav in Apache Jackrabbit 2.4.x before 2.4.6, 2.6.x before 2.6.6, 2.8.x before 2.8.3, 2.10.x before 2.10.4, 2.12.x before 2.12.4, and 2.13.x before 2.13.3 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of unspecified victims for requests that create a resource via an HTTP POST request with a (1) missing or (2) crafted Content-Type header.
      Apache Shiro before 1.3.2 allows attackers to bypass intended servlet filters and gain access by leveraging use of a non-root servlet context path.
      An installer defect known as an "unquoted Windows search path vulnerability" affected the Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.3 installers for Windows. The PC must have previously been infected by a Trojan Horse application (or user) running with administrative privilege. Any installer with the unquoted search path vulnerability becomes a delayed trigger for the exploit.
      The Apache OpenOffice installer (versions prior to 4.1.3, including some branded as OpenOffice.org) for Windows contains a defective operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This requires that the location in which the installer is run has been previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link library that the installer depends upon.
      Apache Ignite before 1.9 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to read arbitrary files via XXE in modified update-notifier documents.
      Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0, 7.x before 7.5.0, and 8.0.0-M1 provide a CSRF prevention measure that fails to discover some cross origin requests. The mitigation is to not only check the Origin HTTP header, but also take the Referer HTTP header into account when no Origin was provided. Furthermore, not all Wicket server side targets were subjected to the CSRF check. This was also fixed.
      Custom commands may be executed on Ambari Agent (2.4.x, before 2.4.2) hosts without authorization, leading to unauthorized access to operations that may affect the underlying system.

      Buffer overflow in Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk) before 1.2.42.
      Apache Tika before 1.14 allows Java code execution for serialized objects embedded in MATLAB files. The issue exists because Tika invokes JMatIO to do native deserialization.
      The HTTP transport module in Apache CXF prior to 3.0.12 and 3.1.x prior to 3.1.9 uses FormattedServiceListWriter to provide an HTML page which lists the names and absolute URL addresses of the available service endpoints. The module calculates the base URL using the current HttpServletRequest. The calculated base URL is used by FormattedServiceListWriter to build the service endpoint absolute URLs. If the unexpected matrix parameters have been injected into the request URL then these matrix parameters will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client.
      In Apache Ranger before 0.6.2, users with "keyadmin" role should not be allowed to change password for users with "admin" role.
      The code in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M11, 8.5.0 to 8.5.6, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.38, 7.0.0 to 7.0.72, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.47 that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own.
      The HTTP/2 header parser in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M11 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.6 entered an infinite loop if a header was received that was larger than the available buffer. This made a denial of service attack possible.

      Characters from languages are such as Arabic, Hebrew are displayed from RTL (Right To Left) order in Opera 37.0.2192.105088 for Android, due to mishandling of several unicode characters such as U+FE70, U+0622, U+0623 etc and how they are rendered combined with (first strong character) such as an IP address or alphabet could lead to a spoofed URL. It was noticed that by placing neutral characters such as "/", "?" in filepath causes the URL to be flipped and displayed from Right To Left. However, in order for the URL to be spoofed the URL must begin with an IP address followed by neutral characters as omnibox considers IP address to be combination of punctuation and numbers and since LTR (Left To Right) direction is not properly enforced, this causes the entire URL to be treated and rendered from RTL (Right To Left). However, it doesn't have be an IP address, what matters is that first strong character (generally, alphabetic character) in the URL must be an RTL character.
      Buffer overflow in the Cookie parser in Fortinet FortiOS 4.x before 4.1.11, 4.2.x before 4.2.13, and 4.3.x before 4.3.9 and FortiSwitch before 3.4.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP request, aka EGREGIOUSBLUNDER.

      Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.366 and 19.x through 22.x before 22.0.0.209 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.632 on Linux allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-4173, CVE-2016-4174, CVE-2016-4222, CVE-2016-4226, CVE-2016-4227, CVE-2016-4228, CVE-2016-4229, CVE-2016-4230, CVE-2016-4231, and CVE-2016-4248.
      FreeIPA uses a default password policy that locks an account after 5 unsuccessful authentication attempts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by locking out the account in which system services run on.
      The RGW code in Ceph before 10.0.1, when authenticated-read ACL is applied to a bucket, allows remote attackers to list the bucket contents via a URL.
      sudo_noexec.so in Sudo before 1.8.15 on Linux might allow local users to bypass intended noexec command restrictions via an application that calls the (1) system or (2) popen function.
      Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the admin pages in dashbuilder in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.3.2 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
      The dashbuilder in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.3.2 does not properly handle CSRF tokens generated during an active session and includes them in query strings, which makes easier for remote attackers to (1) bypass CSRF protection mechanisms or (2) conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by obtaining an old token.
      python-jose before 1.3.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging failure to use a constant time comparison for HMAC keys.
      The verify function in Encryption/Symmetric.php in Malcolm Fell jwt before 1.0.3 does not use a timing-safe function for hash comparison, which allows attackers to spoof signatures via a timing attack.
      In Moodle 2.x and 3.x, web service tokens are not invalidated when the user password is changed or forced to be changed.
      The IP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for large crafted packets, as demonstrated by packets that contain only VLAN headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-8666.
      Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 4.1 does not properly handle regular expressions passed to the expression engine via the JSON API and the web-based UI, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary shell commands by leveraging the ability to view and filter collections.
      The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file.
      The unformat_24bit_color function in the format parsing code in Irssi before 0.8.20, when compiled with true-color enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption and crash) via an incomplete 24bit color code.
      The format_send_to_gui function in the format parsing code in Irssi before 0.8.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption and crash) via vectors involving the length of a string.
      Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7, when operating as a reverse-proxy with default buffer sizes, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and disk consumption) via a long URL.
      SerializableProvider in RESTEasy in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux HPC Node 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
      XmlMapper in the Jackson XML dataformat component (aka jackson-dataformat-xml) before 2.7.8 and 2.8.x before 2.8.4 allows remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks via vectors related to a DTD.
      crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by triggering a CRL operation.
      In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.
      In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
      There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.
      The web interface in Red Hat QuickStart Cloud Installer (QCI) 1.0 does not mask passwords fields, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive password information by reading the display.
      rhscon-ceph in Red Hat Storage Console 2 x86_64 and Red Hat Storage Console Node 2 x86_64 allows local users to obtain the password as cleartext.

      An exploitable uninitialized variable vulnerability which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML a stack variable will be left uninitialized which will later be used to fetch a length that is used in a copy operation. In most cases this will allow an aggressor to write outside the bounds of a stack buffer which is used to contain colors. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running the tool.
      An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a PDF containing a malformed font to XML, the tool will attempt to use a size out of the font to search through a linked list of buffers to return. Due to a signedness issue, a buffer smaller than the requested size will be returned. Later when the tool tries to populate this buffer, the overflow will occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the user running the tool.
      An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF with an object encoded w/ multiple encoding types terminating with an LZW encoded type, an overflow may occur due to a lack of bounds checking by the LZW decoder. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account of the user running it.
      An exploitable arbitrary heap-overwrite vulnerability exists within Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML, it will explicitly trust an index within the specific font object and use it to write the font's name to a single object within an array of objects.
      An exploitable integer-overflow vulnerability exists within Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML, it will attempt to convert each character from a font into a polygon and then attempt to rasterize these shapes. As the application attempts to iterate through the rows and initializing the polygon shape in the buffer, it will write outside of the bounds of said buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running it.

      Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs. SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML should unmarshal data to a Java type. In the default configuration in Brooklyn before 0.10.0, SnakeYAML will allow unmarshalling to any Java type available on the classpath. This could provide an authenticated user with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run Java code without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the privileges of the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability to open files and network connections, and execute system commands. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability.
      A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.

      GitLab versions 8.9.x and above contain a critical security flaw in the "import/export project" feature of GitLab. Added in GitLab 8.9, this feature allows a user to export and then re-import their projects as tape archive files (tar). All GitLab versions prior to 8.13.0 restricted this feature to administrators only. Starting with version 8.13.0 this feature was made available to all users. This feature did not properly check for symbolic links in user-provided archives and therefore it was possible for an authenticated user to retrieve the contents of any file accessible to the GitLab service account. This included sensitive files such as those that contain secret tokens used by the GitLab service to authenticate users.

      go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES algorithm. When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check that the received public key on a message is on the same curve as the static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.
      go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from multiple signatures exploitation. The go-jose library supports messages with multiple signatures. However, when validating a signed message the API did not indicate which signature was valid, which could potentially lead to confusion. For example, users of the library might mistakenly read protected header values from an attached signature that was different from the one originally validated.
      go-jose before 1.0.5 suffers from a CBC-HMAC integer overflow on 32-bit architectures. An integer overflow could lead to authentication bypass for CBC-HMAC encrypted ciphertexts on 32-bit architectures.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from session fixation, by allowing arbitrary session identifiers to be forced and, at the same time, by not invalidating the existing session upon a successful authentication. Under some circumstances, that could have been an opportunity for an attacker to steal an authenticated session.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from persistent XSS. Usernames are not properly escaped when displayed in the audit trail widget of the dashboard upon login, allowing persistent XSS attacks. An authenticated user with enough privileges to create other users could exploit the vulnerability to access the administrator account.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The password recovery form in Revive Adserver is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This vulnerability could be exploited to send a large number of password recovery emails to the registered users, especially in conjunction with a bug that caused recovery emails to be sent to all the users at once. Both issues have been fixed.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from reflected XSS. The affiliate-preview.php script in www/admin is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to steal the session ID of an authenticated user, by tricking them into visiting a specifically crafted URL.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Information Exposure Through Discrepancy. It is possible to check whether or not an email address was associated to one or more user accounts on a target Revive Adserver instance by examining the message printed by the password recovery system. Such information cannot however be used directly to log in to the system, which requires a username.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Persistent XSS. A vector for persistent XSS attacks via the Revive Adserver user interface exists, requiring a trusted (non-admin) account. The website name wasn't properly escaped when displayed in the campaign-zone.php script.

      Exponent CMS 2.4 uses PHP reflection to call a method of a controller class, and then uses the method name to check user permission. But, the method name in PHP reflection is case insensitive, and Exponent CMS permits undefined actions to execute by default, so an attacker can use a capitalized method name to bypass the permission check, e.g., controller=expHTMLEditor&action=preview&editor=ckeditor and controller=expHTMLEditor&action=Preview&editor=ckeditor. An anonymous user will be rejected for the former but can access the latter.
      In /framework/modules/ecommerce/controllers/orderController.php of Exponent CMS 2.4.0, untrusted input is passed into selectObjectsBySql.

      The t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile function in LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a JPEG file with a TIFFTAG_JPEGTABLES of length one.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Persistent XSS. A vector for persistent XSS attacks via the Revive Adserver user interface exists, requiring a trusted (non-admin) account. The banner image URL for external banners wasn't properly escaped when displayed in most of the banner related pages.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). A number of scripts in Revive Adserver's user interface are vulnerable to CSRF attacks: `www/admin/banner-acl.php`, `www/admin/banner-activate.php`, `www/admin/banner-advanced.php`, `www/admin/banner-modify.php`, `www/admin/banner-swf.php`, `www/admin/banner-zone.php`, `www/admin/tracker-modify.php`.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The Revive Adserver team conducted a security audit of the admin interface scripts in order to identify and fix other potential CSRF vulnerabilities. Over 20+ such issues were fixed.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Reflected XSS. `www/admin/stats.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via multiple parameters that are not properly sanitised or escaped when displayed, such as setPerPage, pageId, bannerid, period_start, period_end, and possibly others.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a log pollution vulnerability potentially leading to a local XSS. The download log functionality in the admin screen is delivering the log in JSON format to the end-user. The file was delivered with an attachment disposition forcing the browser to download the document. However, Firefox running on Microsoft Windows would offer the user to open the data in the browser as an HTML document. Thus any injected data in the log would be executed.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a content-spoofing attack in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying edit check permissions on WebDAV copy actions. The WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to modify existing files.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying restore privileges when restoring a file. The restore capability of Nextcloud/ownCloud was not verifying whether a user has only read-only access to a share. Thus a user with read-only access was able to restore old versions.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.1.2, 9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged-in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're not affected by this vulnerability.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in the group.
      Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Stored XSS in CardDAV image export. The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in Nextcloud/ownCloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.
      Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Reflected XSS in the Gallery application. The gallery app was not properly sanitizing exception messages from the Nextcloud/ownCloud server. Due to an endpoint where an attacker could influence the error message, this led to a reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the dav app. The exception message displayed on the DAV endpoints contained partially user-controllable input leading to a potential misrepresentation of information.
      Multiple versions of GitLab expose a dangerous method to any authenticated user that could lead to the deletion of all Issue and MergeRequest objects on a GitLab instance. For GitLab instances with publicly available projects this vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated user. A fix was included in versions 8.14.3, 8.13.8, and 8.12.11, which were released on December 5th 2016 at 3:59 PST. The GitLab versions vulnerable to this are 8.13.0, 8.13.0-ee, 8.13.1, 8.13.1-ee, 8.13.2, 8.13.2-ee, 8.13.3, 8.13.3-ee, 8.13.4, 8.13.4-ee, 8.13.5, 8.13.5-ee, 8.13.6, 8.13.6-ee, 8.13.7, 8.14.0, 8.14.0-ee, 8.14.1, 8.14.2, and 8.14.2-ee.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected File Download. `www/delivery/asyncspc.php` was vulnerable to the fairly new Reflected File Download (RFD) web attack vector that enables attackers to gain complete control over a victim's machine by virtually downloading a file from a trusted domain.
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.
      <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/75.html">CWE-75: Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)</a>
      Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected XSS. The Revive Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost, dbUser, and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective.
      Brave Browser iOS before 1.2.18 and Brave Browser Android 1.9.56 and earlier suffer from Full Address Bar Spoofing, allowing attackers to trick a victim by displaying a malicious page for legitimate domain names.

      tools/tiffcp.c in libtiff 4.0.6 has an out-of-bounds write on tiled images with odd tile width versus image width. Reported as MSVR 35103, aka "cpStripToTile heap-buffer-overflow."
      The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.
      The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.
      The sctp_sf_ootb function in net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.8 lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds slab access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP data.

      An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Framework before 3.2.18, 4.2.x before 4.2.9, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. Paths provided to the ResourceServlet were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks.
      An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before 3.2.10, 4.1.x before 4.1.4, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded "/" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected. Users of other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected.
      An issue was discovered in Cloud Foundry Foundation cf-release versions prior to v250 and CAPI-release versions prior to v1.12.0. Cloud Foundry logs the credentials returned from service brokers in Cloud Controller system component logs. These logs are written to disk and often sent to a log aggregator via syslog.
      An issue was discovered in Pivotal GemFire for PCF 1.6.x versions prior to 1.6.5 and 1.7.x versions prior to 1.7.1. The gfsh (Geode Shell) endpoint, used by operators and application developers to connect to their cluster, is unauthenticated and publicly accessible. Because HTTPS communications are terminated at the gorouter, communications from the gorouter to GemFire clusters are unencrypted. An attacker could run any command available on gfsh and could cause denial of service, lost confidentiality of data, escalate privileges, or eavesdrop on other communications between the gorouter and the cluster.
      An error within the "tar_directory_for_file()" function (gsf-infile-tar.c) in GNOME Structured File Library before 1.14.41 can be exploited to trigger a Null pointer dereference and subsequently cause a crash via a crafted TAR file.
      Some forms with the parameter geo_zoomlevel_to_found_location in Tiki Wiki CMS 12.x before 12.10 LTS, 15.x before 15.3 LTS, and 16.x before 16.1 don't have the input sanitized, related to tiki-setup.php and article_image.php. The impact is XSS.
      Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in admin/media.php and admin/media_item.php in Dotclear before 2.11 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the upfiletitle or media_title parameter (aka the media title).
      The esets_daemon service in ESET Endpoint Antivirus for macOS before 6.4.168.0 and Endpoint Security for macOS before 6.4.168.0 does not properly verify X.509 certificates from the edf.eset.com SSL server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof this server and provide crafted responses to license activation requests via a self-signed certificate.  NOTE: this issue can be combined with CVE-2016-0718 to execute arbitrary code remotely as root.
      Quick Emulator (Qemu) built with the USB redirector usb-guest support is vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It could occur while destroying the USB redirector in 'usbredir_handle_destroy'. A guest user/process could use this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for a host.

      An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x before 13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated using a space the code responsible for parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still processed and the crash occurs.
      An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1, 13.x before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact\x01: will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you.
      Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a bug in its ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a memory block based on the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there is not enough content octets in the ASN.1 object, then the function will fail and the memory block will be zeroed even if its unused. There is a noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation.
      Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer before 0.9.11 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the client drawing area.
      Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer before 0.9.11 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO payload decompressed length exceeds what is specified by the tile dimensions.
      An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. In apport/ui.py, Apport reads the CrashDB field and it then evaluates the field as Python code if it begins with a "{". This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Python code.
      An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. There is a path traversal issue in the Apport crash file "Package" and "SourcePackage" fields. These fields are used to build a path to the package specific hook files in the /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory. An attacker can exploit this path traversal to execute arbitrary Python files from the local system.
      An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. A malicious Apport crash file can contain a restart command in `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline` fields. This command will be executed if a user clicks the Relaunch button on the Apport prompt from the malicious crash file. The fix is to only show the Relaunch button on Apport crash files generated by local systems. The Relaunch button will be hidden when crash files are opened directly in Apport-GTK.
      The backtrack compilation code in the Irregex package (aka IrRegular Expressions) before 0.9.6 for Scheme allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted regular expression with a repeating pattern.

      game-music-emu before 0.6.1 mishandles unspecified integer values.
      RunC allowed additional container processes via 'runc exec' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.
      Exim before 4.87.1 might allow remote attackers to obtain the private DKIM signing key via vectors related to log files and bounce messages.
      redirect() in bottle.py in bottle 0.12.10 doesn't filter a "\r\n" sequence, which leads to a CRLF attack, as demonstrated by a redirect("233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt") call.
