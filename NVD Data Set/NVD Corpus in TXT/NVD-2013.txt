      Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Java 7 before Update 11 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by (1) using the public getMBeanInstantiator method in the JmxMBeanServer class to obtain a reference to a private MBeanInstantiator object, then retrieving arbitrary Class references using the findClass method, and (2) using the Reflection API with recursion in a way that bypasses a security check by the java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.checkSecurityManager method due to the inability of the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass method to skip frames related to the new reflection API, as exploited in the wild in January 2013, as demonstrated by Blackhole and Nuclear Pack, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4681 and CVE-2012-3174. NOTE: some parties have mapped the recursive Reflection API issue to CVE-2012-3174, but CVE-2012-3174 is for a different vulnerability whose details are not public as of 20130114.  CVE-2013-0422 covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6 is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security checks.  NOTE: as of 20130114, a reliable third party has claimed that the findClass/MBeanInstantiator vector was not fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 11.  If there is still a vulnerable condition, then a separate CVE identifier might be created for the unfixed issue.

      Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly clear previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR to extend the state components of a saved or restored vCPU after touching other restored extended registers, which allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by reading the registers.
      The authentication framework (django.contrib.auth) in Django 1.4.x before 1.4.8, 1.5.x before 1.5.4, and 1.6.x before 1.6 beta 4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long password which is then hashed.
      A certain Debian patch for txt2man 1.5.5, as used in txt2man 1.5.5-2, 1.5.5-4, and others, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on /tmp/2222.
      The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.
      OpenJPEG 1.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or crash) via unspecified vectors related to NULL pointer dereferences, division-by-zero, and other errors.
      Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9, when the Proxy Settings configuration has the same Proxy address and Port values in the HTTP and Secure rows, does not properly reuse TCP sessions to the proxy server, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information intended for a specific host via a crafted HTML document that triggers many HTTPS requests and then triggers an HTTP request to that host, as demonstrated by reading a Cookie header, aka MSRC 12096gd.
      Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9, when the Proxy Settings configuration has the same Proxy address and Port values in the HTTP and Secure rows, does not ensure that the SSL lock icon is consistent with the Address bar, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof web sites via a crafted HTML document that triggers many HTTPS requests to an arbitrary host, followed by an HTTPS request to a trusted host and then an HTTP request to an untrusted host, a related issue to CVE-2013-1450.
      plugins/system/highlight/highlight.php in Joomla! 3.0.x through 3.0.2 and 2.5.x through 2.5.8 allows attackers to unserialize arbitrary PHP objects to obtain sensitive information, delete arbitrary directories, conduct SQL injection attacks, and possibly have other impacts via the highlight parameter.

      Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 10 and Update 11, when running on Windows using Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome, allows remote attackers to bypass the "Very High" security level of the Java Control Panel and execute unsigned Java code without prompting the user via unknown vectors, aka "Issue 53" and the "Java Security Slider" vulnerability.
      Per: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html
"This issue (CVE-2013-1489) has been discussed publicly and is sometimes known as the "Java Security Slider vulnerability". It has a CVSS of 0 because it does not directly result in an exploitation, but may be combined with other vulnerabilities to allow blind exploitation. When the Security Slider is set to the default (high) all unsigned applets must be authorized via a dialog box by a browser user in order to execute. This provides the browser operator the opportunity to prevent execution of suspicious applets that may result in successful exploits. However, when CVE-2013-1489 is combined with vulnerabilities that can be used to cause direct impacts, the effect can be that the impact can be caused "silently" without the authorization dialog box."
