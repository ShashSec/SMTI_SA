      An error in the implementation of an autosubscribe feature in the check_stream_exists route of the Zulip group chat application server before 1.4.3 allowed an authenticated user to subscribe to a private stream that should have required an invitation from an existing member to join. The issue affects all previously released versions of the Zulip server.
      Multiple versions of GitLab expose sensitive user credentials when assigning a user to an issue or merge request. A fix was included in versions 8.15.8, 8.16.7, and 8.17.4, which were released on March 20th 2017 at 23:59 UTC.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a permission increase on re-sharing via OCS API issue. A permission related issue within the OCS sharing API allowed an authenticated adversary to reshare shared files with an increasing permission set. This may allow an attacker to edit files in a share despite having only a 'read' permission set. Note that this only affects folders and files that the adversary has at least read-only permissions for.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a creation of folders in read-only folders despite lacking permissions issue. Due to a logical error in the file caching layer an authenticated adversary is able to create empty folders inside a shared folder. Note that this only affects folders and files that the adversary has at least read-only permissions for.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a error message disclosing existence of file in write-only share. Due to an error in the application logic an adversary with access to a write-only share may enumerate the names of existing files and subfolders by comparing the exception messages.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a Denial of Service attack. Due to an error in the application logic an authenticated adversary may trigger an endless recursion in the application leading to a potential Denial of Service.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a bypass in the quota limitation. Due to not properly sanitizing values provided by the `OC-Total-Length` HTTP header an authenticated adversary may be able to exceed their configured user quota. Thus using more space than allowed by the administrator.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a Content-Spoofing vulnerability in the "files" app. The top navigation bar displayed in the files list contained partially user-controllable input leading to a potential misrepresentation of information.
      Paperclip ruby gem version 3.1.4 and later suffers from a Server-SIde Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Paperclip::UriAdapter class. Attackers may be able to access information about internal network resources.
      Nextcloud Server before 11.0.3 is vulnerable to an inadequate escaping leading to a XSS vulnerability in the search module. To be exploitable a user has to write or paste malicious content into the search dialogue.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.58 and 10.0.5 and 11.0.3 are vulnerable to an inadequate escaping of error messages leading to XSS vulnerabilities in multiple components.
      Nextcloud Server before 11.0.3 is vulnerable to an improper session handling allowed an application specific password without permission to the files access to the users file.
      Nextcloud Server before 9.0.58 and 10.0.5 and 11.0.3 are shipping a vulnerable JavaScript library for sanitizing untrusted user-input which suffered from a XSS vulnerability caused by a behaviour change in Safari 10.1 and 10.2. Note that Nextcloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy preventing exploitation of this XSS issue on modern web browsers.
      Nextcloud Server before 11.0.3 is vulnerable to disclosure of valid share tokens for public calendars due to a logical error. Thus granting an attacker potentially access to publicly shared calendars without knowing the share token.
      Nextcloud Server before 10.0.4 and 11.0.2 are vulnerable to disclosure of calendar and addressbook names to other logged-in users. Note that no actual content of the calendar and addressbook has been disclosed.
      Zulip Server 1.5.1 and below suffer from an error in the implementation of the invite_by_admins_only setting in the Zulip group chat application server that allowed an authenticated user to invite other users to join a Zulip organization even if the organization was configured to prevent this.
      ExpressionEngine version 2.x < 2.11.8 and version 3.x < 3.5.5 create an object signing token with weak entropy. Successfully guessing the token can lead to remote code execution.
      Ruby before 2.4.2, 2.3.5, and 2.2.8 is vulnerable to a malicious format string which contains a precious specifier (*) with a huge minus value. Such situation can lead to a buffer overrun, resulting in a heap memory corruption or an information disclosure from the heap.
      RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to maliciously crafted gem specifications that include terminal escape characters. Printing the gem specification would execute terminal escape sequences.
      RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to maliciously crafted gem specifications to cause a denial of service attack against RubyGems clients who have issued a `query` command.
      RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier fails to validate specification names, allowing a maliciously crafted gem to potentially overwrite any file on the filesystem.
      RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to a DNS hijacking vulnerability that allows a MITM attacker to force the RubyGems client to download and install gems from a server that the attacker controls.

      Parameterized Trigger Plugin fails to check Item/Build permission: The Parameterized Trigger Plugin did not check the build authentication it was running as and allowed triggering any other project in Jenkins.
      Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository as part of form validation (e.g. to retrieve a list of tags). This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to connect to any web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
      The Periodic Backup Plugin did not perform any permission checks, allowing any user with Overall/Read access to change its settings, trigger backups, restore backups, download backups, and also delete all previous backups via log rotation. Additionally, the plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
      GitHub Branch Source provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use. This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
      The Sidebar Link plugin allows users able to configure jobs, views, and agents to add entries to the sidebar of these objects. There was no input validation, which meant users were able to use javascript: schemes for these links.
      Builds in Jenkins are associated with an authentication that controls the permissions that the build has to interact with other elements in Jenkins. The Pipeline: Build Step Plugin did not check the build authentication it was running as and allowed triggering any other project in Jenkins.
      Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to add administrator role to any user, or to remove the authorization configuration, preventing legitimate access to Jenkins.
      GitHub Branch Source Plugin connects to a user-specified GitHub API URL (e.g. GitHub Enterprise) as part of form validation and completion (e.g. to verify Scan Credentials are correct). This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to any web server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery.
      Git Plugin connects to a user-specified Git repository as part of form validation. An attacker with no direct access to Jenkins but able to guess at a username/password credentials ID could trick a developer with job configuration permissions into following a link with a maliciously crafted Jenkins URL which would result in the Jenkins Git client sending the username and password to an attacker-controlled server.
      Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.
      Docker Commons Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use to authenticate with a Docker Registry. This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
      The default whitelist included the following unsafe entries: DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object); DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String). These allowed circumventing many of the access restrictions implemented in the script sandbox by using e.g. currentBuild['rawBuild'] rather than currentBuild.rawBuild. Additionally, the following entries allowed accessing private data that would not be accessible otherwise due to script security: groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Closure); groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Object).
      Arbitrary code execution due to incomplete sandbox protection: Constructors, instance variable initializers, and instance initializers in Pipeline scripts were not subject to sandbox protection, and could therefore execute arbitrary code. This could be exploited e.g. by regular Jenkins users with the permission to configure Pipelines in Jenkins, or by trusted committers to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles.
      On Darwin, user's trust preferences for root certificates were not honored. If the user had a root certificate loaded in their Keychain that was explicitly not trusted, a Go program would still verify a connection using that root certificate.
      The net/http package's Request.ParseMultipartForm method starts writing to temporary files once the request body size surpasses the given "maxMemory" limit. It was possible for an attacker to generate a multipart request crafted such that the server ran out of file descriptors.
      When asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a feature that outputs meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers. The code doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user (stdout or the application's provide callback), which could lead to other private data from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer was an uninitialized memory area allocated on the heap and if it turned out to not contain any zero byte, it would continue and display the data following that buffer in memory.
      Vulnerability in the Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition component of Oracle Hospitality Applications (subcomponent: Core). The supported version that is affected is 1.7.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H).
      When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This too large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto() function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.
      curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.
      The Details view of some Static Analysis Utilities based plugins, was vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability: Malicious users able to influence the input to these plugins, for example the console output which is parsed to extract build warnings (Warnings Plugin), could insert arbitrary HTML into this view.
      The custom Details view of the Static Analysis Utilities based DRY Plugin, was vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability: Malicious users able to influence the input to this plugin could insert arbitrary HTML into this view.
      The Config File Provider Plugin is used to centrally manage configuration files that often include secrets, such as passwords. Users with only Overall/Read access to Jenkins were able to access URLs directly that allowed viewing these files. Access to view these files now requires sufficient permissions to configure the provided files, view the configuration of the folder in which the configuration files are defined, or have Job/Configure permissions to a job able to use these files.
      The optional Run/Artifacts permission can be enabled by setting a Java system property. Blue Ocean did not check this permission before providing access to archived artifacts, Item/Read permission was sufficient.
      Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. Its SCM content REST API supports the pipeline creation and editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content REST API did not check the current user's authentication or credentials. If the GitHub organization folder was created via Blue Ocean, it retained a reference to its creator's GitHub credentials. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to create arbitrary commits in the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub credentials of the creator of the organization folder. Additionally, users with read access to the GitHub organization folder could read arbitrary file contents from the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder if the branch contained a Jenkinsfile (which could be created using the other part of this vulnerability), and they could provide the organization folder name, repository name, branch name, and file name.
      Script Security Plugin did not apply sandboxing restrictions to constructor invocations via positional arguments list, super constructor invocations, method references, and type coercion expressions. This could be used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods, bypassing sandbox protection.
      The Pipeline: Input Step Plugin by default allowed users with Item/Read access to a pipeline to interact with the step to provide input. This has been changed, and now requires users to have the Item/Build permission instead.
      The custom Details view of the Static Analysis Utilities based OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin, was vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability: Malicious users able to influence the input to this plugin could insert arbitrary HTML into this view.
      Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. It did not properly check the current user's authentication and authorization when configuring existing GitHub organization folders. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to reconfigure it, including changing the GitHub API endpoint for the organization folder to an attacker-controlled server to obtain the GitHub access token, if the organization folder was initially created using Blue Ocean.
      Linux kernel: heap out-of-bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.
      Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18 2005.
      The Deploy to container Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration. This allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access, or users with Extended Read access to the jobs it is used in, to retrieve those passwords. The Deploy to container Plugin now integrates with Credentials Plugin to store passwords securely, and automatically migrates existing passwords.
      The Datadog Plugin stores an API key to access the Datadog service in the global Jenkins configuration. While the API key is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the API key for example through browser extensions or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The Datadog Plugin now encrypts the API key transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.
      Mercurial prior to version 4.3 is vulnerable to a missing symlink check that can malicious repositories to modify files outside the repository
      Mercurial prior to 4.3 did not adequately sanitize hostnames passed to ssh, leading to possible shell-injection attacks.
      A malicious third-party can give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that exists on the victim's machine being executed. Such a URL could be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project, and an unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running "git clone --recurse-submodules" to trigger the vulnerability.

      Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
      libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.
      On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written. This flaw was introduced in commit: "5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable transactional memory (TM) lazily for userspace)" which was merged upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.
      libvirt version 2.3.0 and later is vulnerable to a bad default configuration of "verify-peer=no" passed to QEMU by libvirt resulting in a failure to validate SSL/TLS certificates by default.
      An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.
      Vulnerability in the Solaris component of Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite (subcomponent: Network Services Library). The supported version that is affected is 10. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Solaris executes to compromise Solaris. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Solaris accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Solaris accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Solaris. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).

      The re-key admin monitor was introduced in Jenkins 1.498 and re-encrypted all secrets in JENKINS_HOME with a new key. It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and delete it if present.
      Linux drivers/char/lp.c Out-of-Bounds Write. Due to a missing bounds check, and the fact that parport_ptr integer is static, a 'secure boot' kernel command line adversary (can happen due to bootloader vulns, e.g. Google Nexus 6's CVE-2016-10277, where due to a vulnerability the adversary has partial control over the command line) can overflow the parport_nr array in the following code, by appending many (>LP_NO) 'lp=none' arguments to the command line.
      An issue was discovered in the size of the stack guard page on Linux, specifically a 4k stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier (the stackguard page was introduced in 2010).
      The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not take the argument and environment pointers into account, which allows attackers to bypass this limitation. This affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier. It appears that this feature was introduced in the Linux Kernel version 2.6.23.
      glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc 2.25 and earlier.

      The offset2lib patch as used in the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings then the stack occupies the address 0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above 0x40000000 nullifying the protection of the offset2lib patch. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5 and earlier. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000371. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.
      The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability, if RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory is allocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction) then the stack will be grown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000 the minimum distance between the end of the PIE binary's read-write segment and the start of the stack becomes small enough that the stack guard page can be jumped over by an attacker. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.
      A flaw exists in OpenBSD's implementation of the stack guard page that allows attackers to bypass it resulting in arbitrary code execution using setuid binaries such as /usr/bin/at. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.
      The OpenBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.
      A flaw exists in NetBSD's implementation of the stack guard page that allows attackers to bypass it resulting in arbitrary code execution using certain setuid binaries. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
      NetBSD maps the run-time link-editor ld.so directly below the stack region, even if ASLR is enabled, this allows attackers to more easily manipulate memory leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
      libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.
      An issue was discovered in the size of the default stack guard page on PAX Linux (originally from GRSecurity but shipped by other Linux vendors), specifically the default stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects PAX Linux Kernel versions as of June 19, 2017 (specific version information is not available at this time).
      The NetBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
      The Linux Kernel running on AMD64 systems will sometimes map the contents of PIE executable, the heap or ld.so to where the stack is mapped allowing attackers to more easily manipulate the stack. Linux Kernel version 4.11.5 is affected.
      sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.5 is vulnerable to a data race in the ALSA /dev/snd/timer driver resulting in local users being able to read information belonging to other users, i.e., uninitialized memory contents may be disclosed when a read and an ioctl happen at the same time.
      The c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, which is used for parsing NAPTR responses, could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input buffer if the passed in DNS response packet was crafted in a particular way.
      VIM version 8.0.1187 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a swap file ("[ORIGINAL_FILENAME].swp") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the vi binary.
      GNU Emacs version 25.3.1 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a backup save file ("[ORIGINAL_FILENAME]~") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the emacs binary.
      The Erlang otp TLS server answers with different TLS alerts to different error types in the RSA PKCS #1 1.5 padding. This allows an attacker to decrypt content or sign messages with the server's private key (this is a variation of the Bleichenbacher attack).
      Vulnerability in the Solaris component of Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite (subcomponent: Kernel). Supported versions that are affected are 10 and 11. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Solaris executes to compromise Solaris. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Solaris. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
      The Linux Kernel versions 2.6.38 through 4.14 have a problematic use of pmd_mkdirty() in the touch_pmd() function inside the THP implementation. touch_pmd() can be reached by get_user_pages(). In such case, the pmd will become dirty. This scenario breaks the new can_follow_write_pmd()'s logic - pmd can become dirty without going through a COW cycle. This bug is not as severe as the original "Dirty cow" because an ext4 file (or any other regular file) cannot be mapped using THP. Nevertheless, it does allow us to overwrite read-only huge pages. For example, the zero huge page and sealed shmem files can be overwritten (since their mapping can be populated using THP). Note that after the first write page-fault to the zero page, it will be replaced with a new fresh (and zeroed) thp.
      OpenDaylight Karaf 0.6.1-Carbon fails to clear the cache after a password change, allowing the old password to be used until the Karaf cache is manually cleared (e.g. via restart).
      The Linux Kernel 2.6.32 and later are affected by a denial of service, by flooding the diagnostic port 0x80 an exception can be triggered leading to a kernel panic.
      The Linux kernel version 3.3-rc1 and later is affected by a vulnerability lies in the processing of incoming L2CAP commands - ConfigRequest, and ConfigResponse messages. This info leak is a result of uninitialized stack variables that may be returned to an attacker in their uninitialized state. By manipulating the code flows that precede the handling of these configuration messages, an attacker can also gain some control over which data will be held in the uninitialized stack variables. This can allow him to bypass KASLR, and stack canaries protection - as both pointers and stack canaries may be leaked in this manner. Combining this vulnerability (for example) with the previously disclosed RCE vulnerability in L2CAP configuration parsing (CVE-2017-1000251) may allow an attacker to exploit the RCE against kernels which were built with the above mitigations. These are the specifics of this vulnerability: In the function l2cap_parse_conf_rsp and in the function l2cap_parse_conf_req the following variable is declared without initialization: struct l2cap_conf_efs efs; In addition, when parsing input configuration parameters in both of these functions, the switch case for handling EFS elements may skip the memcpy call that will write to the efs variable: ... case L2CAP_CONF_EFS: if (olen == sizeof(efs)) memcpy(&efs, (void *)val, olen); ... The olen in the above if is attacker controlled, and regardless of that if, in both of these functions the efs variable would eventually be added to the outgoing configuration request that is being built: l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr, L2CAP_CONF_EFS, sizeof(efs), (unsigned long) &efs); So by sending a configuration request, or response, that contains an L2CAP_CONF_EFS element, but with an element length that is not sizeof(efs) - the memcpy to the uninitialized efs variable can be avoided, and the uninitialized variable would be returned to the attacker (16 bytes).

      An XML injection vulnerability in Junos OS CLI can allow a locally authenticated user to elevate privileges and run arbitrary commands as the root user. This issue was found during internal product security testing. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D47, 15.1 prior to 15.1R3. Junos versions prior to 15.1 are not affected. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
      When the device is configured to perform account lockout with a defined period of time, any unauthenticated user attempting to log in as root with an incorrect password can trigger a lockout of the root account. When an SRX Series device is in cluster mode, and a cluster sync or failover operation occurs, then there will be errors associated with synch or failover while the root account is locked out. Administrators can confirm if the root account is locked out via the following command root@device> show system login lockout user root User Lockout start Lockout end root 1995-01-01 01:00:01 PDT 1995-11-01 01:31:01 PDT Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D65 on SRX series; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D45 on SRX series; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D75 on SRX series.
      On all vSRX and SRX Series devices, when the DHCP or DHCP relay is configured, specially crafted packet might cause the flowd process to crash, halting or interrupting traffic from flowing through the device(s). Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an extended denial of service condition for the device(s). If the device is configured in high-availability, the RG1+ (data-plane) will fail-over to the secondary node. If the device is configured in stand-alone, there will be temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restored automatically. Sustained crafted packets may cause the secondary failover node to fail back, or fail completely, potentially halting flowd on both nodes of the cluster or causing flip-flop failovers to occur. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67 on vSRX or SRX Series; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D50 on vSRX or SRX Series; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D91, 15.1X49-D100 on vSRX or SRX Series.
      Version 4.40 of the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) firmware on Juniper Networks SRX300 Series has a weakness in generating cryptographic keys that may allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information in SRX300 Series products. The TPM is used in the SRX300 Series to encrypt sensitive configuration data. While other products also ship with a TPM, no other products or platforms are affected by this vulnerability. Customers can confirm the version of TPM firmware via the 'show security tpm status' command. This issue was discovered by an external security researcher. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
      Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1R1, and services releases based off of 16.1R1, are vulnerable to the receipt of a crafted BGP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sent directly to the router, which can cause the RPD routing process to crash and restart. Unlike BGP UPDATEs, which are transitive in nature, this issue can only be triggered by a packet sent directly to the IP address of the router. Repeated crashes of the rpd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. This issue only affects devices running Junos OS 16.1R1 and services releases based off of 16.1R1 (e.g. 16.1R1-S1, 16.1R1-S2, 16.1R1-S3). No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this vulnerability, and this issue was resolved in Junos OS 16.2 prior to 16.2R1. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. This issue was found during internal product security testing.
      Any Juniper Networks SRX series device with one or more ALGs enabled may experience a flowd crash when traffic is processed by the Sun/MS-RPC ALGs. This vulnerability in the Sun/MS-RPC ALG services component of Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a repeated denial of service against the target. Repeated traffic in a cluster may cause repeated flip-flop failure operations or full failure to the flowd daemon halting traffic on all nodes. Only IPv6 traffic is affected by this issue. IPv4 traffic is unaffected. This issues is not seen with to-host traffic. This issue has no relation with HA services themselves, only the ALG service. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D55 on SRX; 12.1X47 prior to 12.1X47-D45 on SRX; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D32, 12.3X48-D35 on SRX; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D60 on SRX.
      On SRX Series devices, a crafted ICMP packet embedded within a NAT64 IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel may cause the flowd process to crash. Repeated crashes of the flowd process constitutes an extended denial of service condition for the SRX Series device. This issue only occurs if NAT64 is configured.

      IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X-Force ID: 121151.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The product's protocol only tries to ensure confidentiality. In the whole protocol, no integrity or authenticity checks are done. Therefore man-in-the-middle attackers can conduct replay attacks.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. For authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512 without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat before 1.5.18 for Android. No certificate pinning is implemented; therefore the attacker could issue a certificate for the backend and the application would not notice it.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. To encrypt messages, AES in CBC mode is used with a pseudo-random secret. This secret and the IV are generated with math.random() in previous versions and with CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random() in newer versions, which uses math.random() internally. This is not cryptographically strong.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android. The login credentials are written into a log file on the device. Hence, an attacker with access to the logs can read them.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.
      An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. It uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages. However, the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but transmitted to the backend, too. Moreover, the key to decrypt the private key is composed of the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend, too. Therefore, everyone with access to the backend database can read the transmitted secret for symmetric encryption, hence can read the communication.

      Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has CSRF in diag.cgi. In the panel, the diag.cgi file is responsible for running commands such as ping, ping6, traceroute, traceroute6, nslookup, arp, and Portprobe. These functions do not have any protections against CSRF. That can allow an attacker to run these commands against any IP if they can get an admin to visit their malicious CSRF page.
      Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has Reflected XSS in adminservercacertdetails.cgi. In the admin panel, the certid parameter of adminservercacertdetails.cgi is reflected in the application's response and is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject tags. An attacker could come up with clever payloads to make the system run commands such as ping, ping6, traceroute, nslookup, arp, etc.
      Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has Reflected XSS in launchHelp.cgi. The helpLaunchPage parameter is reflected in an IFRAME element, if the value contains two quotes. It properly sanitizes quotes and tags, so one cannot simply close the src with a quote and inject after that. However, an attacker can use javascript: or data: to abuse this.
      Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has CSRF in logout.cgi. The logout function of the admin panel is not protected by any CSRF tokens, thus allowing an attacker to logout a user by making them visit a malicious web page.

This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.
      An issue was discovered in Varnish HTTP Cache 4.0.1 through 4.0.4, 4.1.0 through 4.1.7, 5.0.0, and 5.1.0 through 5.1.2. A wrong if statement in the varnishd source code means that particular invalid requests from the client can trigger an assert, related to an Integer Overflow. This causes the varnishd worker process to abort and restart, losing the cached contents in the process. An attacker can therefore crash the varnishd worker process on demand and effectively keep it from serving content - a Denial-of-Service attack. The specific source-code filename containing the incorrect statement varies across releases.

      GitHub Electron before 1.6.8 allows remote command execution because of a nodeIntegration bypass vulnerability. This also affects all applications that bundle Electron code equivalent to 1.6.8 or earlier. Bypassing the Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a precondition; however, recent Electron versions do not have strict SOP enforcement. Combining an SOP bypass with a privileged URL internally used by Electron, it was possible to execute native Node.js primitives in order to run OS commands on the user's host. Specifically, a chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html window could be used to eval a Node.js child_process.execFile API call.
      Unprivileged user can access all functions in the Surveillance Station component in QNAP TS212P devices with firmware 4.2.1 build 20160601. Unprivileged user cannot login at front end but with that unprivileged user SID, all function can access at Surveillance Station.

      In Apache Spark 1.6.0 until 2.1.1, the launcher API performs unsafe deserialization of data received by its socket. This makes applications launched programmatically using the launcher API potentially vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by an attacker with access to any user account on the local machine. It does not affect apps run by spark-submit or spark-shell. The attacker would be able to execute code as the user that ran the Spark application. Users are encouraged to update to version 2.2.0 or later.
      When apr_exp_time*() or apr_os_exp_time*() functions are invoked with an invalid month field value in Apache Portable Runtime APR 1.6.2 and prior, out of bounds memory may be accessed in converting this value to an apr_time_exp_t value, potentially revealing the contents of a different static heap value or resulting in program termination, and may represent an information disclosure or denial of service vulnerability to applications which call these APR functions with unvalidated external input.
      When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.
      When using a VirtualDirContext with Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.80 it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs for resources served by the VirtualDirContext using a specially crafted request.
      When running Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0, 8.5.0 to 8.5.22, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.46 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.81 with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.
      Apache Portable Runtime Utility (APR-util) 1.6.0 and prior fail to validate the integrity of SDBM database files used by apr_sdbm*() functions, resulting in a possible out of bound read access. A local user with write access to the database can make a program or process using these functions crash, and cause a denial of service.
      IBM Security Guardium 10.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning, cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 124737.
      When loading models or dictionaries that contain XML it is possible to perform an XXE attack, since Apache OpenNLP is a library, this only affects applications that load models or dictionaries from untrusted sources. The versions 1.5.0 to 1.5.3, 1.6.0, 1.7.0 to 1.7.2, 1.8.0 to 1.8.1 of Apache OpenNLP are affected.
      During Jelly (xml) file parsing with Apache Xerces, if a custom doctype entity is declared with a "SYSTEM" entity with a URL and that entity is used in the body of the Jelly file, during parser instantiation the parser will attempt to connect to said URL. This could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in Apache Commons Jelly before 1.0.1.
      An authorized user could upload a template which contained malicious code and accessed sensitive files via an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. The fix to properly handle XML External Entities was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.4.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.
      Apache CXF supports sending and receiving attachments via either the JAX-WS or JAX-RS specifications. It is possible to craft a message attachment header that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a CXF web service provider. Both JAX-WS and JAX-RS services are vulnerable to this attack. From Apache CXF 3.2.1 and 3.1.14, message attachment headers that are greater than 300 characters will be rejected by default. This value is configurable via the property "attachment-max-header-size".
      Apache Hive 2.1.x before 2.1.2, 2.2.x before 2.2.1, and 2.3.x before 2.3.1 expose an interface through which masking policies can be defined on tables or views, e.g., using Apache Ranger. When a view is created over a given table, the policy enforcement does not happen correctly on the table for masked columns.
      The JMX server embedded in Apache James, also used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands. As James exposes JMX socket by default only on local-host, this vulnerability can only be used for privilege escalation. Release 3.0.1 upgrades the incriminated library.
      Remote code execution occurs in Apache Solr before 7.1 with Apache Lucene before 7.1 by exploiting XXE in conjunction with use of a Config API add-listener command to reach the RunExecutableListener class. Elasticsearch, although it uses Lucene, is NOT vulnerable to this. Note that the XML external entity expansion vulnerability occurs in the XML Query Parser which is available, by default, for any query request with parameters deftype=xmlparser and can be exploited to upload malicious data to the /upload request handler or as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server. Note also that the second vulnerability relates to remote code execution using the RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.
      In Apache Drill 1.11.0 and earlier when submitting form from Query page users are able to pass arbitrary script or HTML which will take effect on Profile page afterwards. Example: after submitting special script that returns cookie information from Query page, malicious user may obtain this information from Profile page afterwards.
      Apache CXF Fediz ships with a number of container-specific plugins to enable WS-Federation for applications. A CSRF (Cross Style Request Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in the Spring 2, Spring 3 and Spring 4 plugins in versions before 1.4.3 and 1.3.3.

      The camel-hessian component in Apache Camel 2.x before 2.19.4 and 2.20.x before 2.20.1 is vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
      The camel-castor component in Apache Camel 2.x before 2.19.4 and 2.20.x before 2.20.1 is vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
      Due to differences in the Erlang-based JSON parser and JavaScript-based JSON parser, it is possible in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to submit _users documents with duplicate keys for 'roles' used for access control within the database, including the special case '_admin' role, that denotes administrative users. In combination with CVE-2017-12636 (Remote Code Execution), this can be used to give non-admin users access to arbitrary shell commands on the server as the database system user. The JSON parser differences result in behaviour that if two 'roles' keys are available in the JSON, the second one will be used for authorising the document write, but the first 'roles' key is used for subsequent authorization for the newly created user. By design, users can not assign themselves roles. The vulnerability allows non-admin users to give themselves admin privileges.
      CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet.

      The http.c:skip_short_body() function is called in some circumstances, such as when processing redirects. When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2, the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to skip the chunk in pieces of 512 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length to connect.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument.
      IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server 11.0 - 11.6 stores user credentials in plain in clear text which can be read by a local user. IBM X-Force ID: 125463.
      The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK responses. When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2, the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to read the chunk in pieces of 8192 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length to retr.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument. The attacker can corrupt malloc metadata after the allocated buffer.

      In the pjsip channel driver (res_pjsip) in Asterisk 13.x before 13.17.1 and 14.x before 14.6.1, a carefully crafted tel URI in a From, To, or Contact header could cause Asterisk to crash.
      In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c in Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized data disclosure (media takeover in the RTP stack) is possible with careful timing by an attacker. The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets that do not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled by default in Asterisk 11 and above. The "nat" and "rtp_symmetric" options (for chan_sip and chan_pjsip, respectively) enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by default, but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP support, this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when expected, the new code allowed a new source address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received, the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media, and (with symmetric RTP enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to this new address, allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker continued to send traffic, they would continue to receive traffic as well.
      In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized command execution is possible. The app_minivm module has an "externnotify" program configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command injection.
      A security researcher found an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability on the Conserus Image Repository archive solution version 2.1.1.105 by McKesson Medical Imaging Company, which is now a Change Healthcare company. An unauthenticated user supplying a modified HTTP SOAP request to the vulnerable service allows for arbitrary file read access to the local file system as well as the transmittal of the application service's account hashed credentials to a remote attacker.
      MIMEDefang 2.80 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname`" command, as demonstrated by the init-script.in and mimedefang-init.in scripts.
      The ReadJNGImage and ReadOneJNGImage functions in coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 do not properly manage image pointers after certain error conditions, which allows remote attackers to conduct use-after-free attacks via a crafted file, related to a ReadMNGImage out-of-order CloseBlob call. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-11403.

      In Apple iOS 7 through 9, due to a BlueBorne flaw in the implementation of LEAP (Low Energy Audio Protocol), a large audio command can be sent to a targeted device and lead to a heap overflow with attacker-controlled data. Since the audio commands sent via LEAP are not properly validated, an attacker can use this overflow to gain full control of the device through the relatively high privileges of the Bluetooth stack in iOS. The attack bypasses Bluetooth access control; however, the default "Bluetooth On" value must be present in Settings.
      A parameter verification issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. The function `alloc_heap_pages` allows callers to specify the first NUMA node that should be used for allocations through the `memflags` parameter; the node is extracted using the `MEMF_get_node` macro. While the function checks to see if the special constant `NUMA_NO_NODE` is specified, it otherwise does not handle the case where `node >= MAX_NUMNODES`. This allows an out-of-bounds access to an internal array.
      A domain cleanup issue was discovered in the C xenstore daemon (aka cxenstored) in Xen through 4.9.x. When shutting down a VM with a stubdomain, a race in cxenstored may cause a double-free. The xenstored daemon may crash, resulting in a DoS of any parts of the system relying on it (including domain creation / destruction, ballooning, device changes, etc.).
      An issue was discovered in Xen 4.5.x through 4.9.x. The function `__gnttab_cache_flush` handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table operations. It checks to see if the calling domain is the owner of the page that is to be operated on. If it is not, the owner's grant table is checked to see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for the page in question. However, the function does not check to see if the owning domain actually has a grant table or not. Some special domains, such as `DOMID_XEN`, `DOMID_IO` and `DOMID_COW` are created without grant tables. Hence, if __gnttab_cache_flush operates on a page owned by these special domains, it will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer in the domain struct.
      A grant unmapping issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. When removing or replacing a grant mapping, the x86 PV specific path needs to make sure page table entries remain in sync with other accounting done. Although the identity of the page frame was validated correctly, neither the presence of the mapping nor page writability were taken into account.

      On Beijing Hanbang Hanbanggaoke devices, because user-controlled input is not sufficiently sanitized, sending a PUT request to /ISAPI/Security/users/1 allows an admin password change.
      When MISP before 2.4.80 is configured with X.509 certificate authentication (CertAuth) in conjunction with a non-MISP external user management ReST API, if an external user provides X.509 certificate authentication and this API returns an empty value, the unauthenticated user can be granted access as an arbitrary user.
      The DNS packet parser in YADIFA before 2.2.6 does not check for the presence of infinite pointer loops, and thus it is possible to force it to enter an infinite loop. This can cause high CPU usage and makes the server unresponsive.
      IBM DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows 11.1 (includes DB2 Connect Server) under unusual circumstances, could expose highly sensitive information in the error log to a local user.

      GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious "sh -c" command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.

      The airbag detonation algorithm allows injury to passenger-car occupants via predictable Security Access (SA) data to the internal CAN bus (or the OBD connector). This affects the airbag control units (aka pyrotechnical control units or PCUs) of unspecified passenger vehicles manufactured in 2014 or later, when the ignition is on and the speed is less than 6 km/h. Specifically, there are only 256 possible key pairs, and authentication attempts have no rate limit. In addition, at least one manufacturer's interpretation of the ISO 26021 standard is that it must be possible to calculate the key directly (i.e., the other 255 key pairs must not be used). Exploitation would typically involve an attacker who has already gained access to the CAN bus, and sends a crafted Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) message to detonate the pyrotechnical charges, resulting in the same passenger-injury risks as in any airbag deployment.

      IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 could provide weaker than expected security after using the Admin Console to update the web services security bindings settings. IBM X-Force ID: 129576.
      A ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) flaw was found in the tough-cookie module before 2.3.3 for Node.js. An attacker that is able to make an HTTP request using a specially crafted cookie may cause the application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.
      The named pipes in qtsingleapp in Qt 5.x, as used in qBittorrent and SugarSync, are configured for remote access and allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an unspecified string.
      OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 does not properly validate the input of the PUT_FILE RPC-command, which allows any authenticated user to hijack an arbitrary file from the Content Server filesystem; because some files on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this leads to privilege escalation.
      OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows an authenticated user to gain superuser privileges: Content Server stores information about uploaded files in dmr_content objects, which are queryable and "editable" (before release 7.2P02, any authenticated user was able to edit dmr_content objects; now any authenticated user may delete a dmr_content object and then create a new one with the old identifier) by authenticated users; this allows any authenticated user to replace the content of security-sensitive dmr_content objects (for example, dmr_content related to dm_method objects) and gain superuser privileges.
      OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows authenticated users to download arbitrary content files regardless of the attacker's repository permissions: When an authenticated user uploads content to the repository, he performs the following steps: (1) calls the START_PUSH RPC-command; (2) uploads the file to the content server; (3) calls the END_PUSH_V2 RPC-command (here, Content Server returns a DATA_TICKET integer, intended to identify the location of the uploaded file on the Content Server filesystem); (4) creates a dmr_content object in the repository, which has a value of data_ticket equal to the value of DATA_TICKET returned at the end of END_PUSH_V2 call. As the result of this design, any authenticated user may create his own dmr_content object, pointing to already existing content in the Content Server filesystem.

      In FreeBSD through 11.1, the smb_strdupin function in sys/netsmb/smb_subr.c has a race condition with a resultant out-of-bounds read, because it can cause t2p->t_name strings to lack a final '\0' character.
      Race condition in the v9fs_xattrwalk function in hw/9pfs/9p.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host heap memory via vectors related to reading extended attributes.
      Cross-site scripting (XSS) exists in Zurmo 3.2.1.57987acc3018 via a data: URL in the redirectUrl parameter to app/index.php/meetings/default/createMeeting.
      IBM WebSphere Application Server version 9.0.0.4 could provide weaker than expected security after using the PasswordUtil command to enable AES password encryption. IBM X-Force ID: 129579.
      Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x before 1.9.1 allows "go get" remote command execution. Using custom domains, it is possible to arrange things so that example.com/pkg1 points to a Subversion repository but example.com/pkg1/pkg2 points to a Git repository. If the Subversion repository includes a Git checkout in its pkg2 directory and some other work is done to ensure the proper ordering of operations, "go get" can be tricked into reusing this Git checkout for the fetch of code from pkg2. If the Subversion repository's Git checkout has malicious commands in .git/hooks/, they will execute on the system running "go get."
      An unintended cleartext issue exists in Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x before 1.9.1. RFC 4954 requires that, during SMTP, the PLAIN auth scheme must only be used on network connections secured with TLS. The original implementation of smtp.PlainAuth in Go 1.0 enforced this requirement, and it was documented to do so. In 2013, upstream issue #5184, this was changed so that the server may decide whether PLAIN is acceptable. The result is that if you set up a man-in-the-middle SMTP server that doesn't advertise STARTTLS and does advertise that PLAIN auth is OK, the smtp.PlainAuth implementation sends the username and password.
      The default installation of DocuWare Fulltext Search server through 6.11 allows remote users to connect to and download searchable text from the embedded Solr service, bypassing DocuWare's access control features of the DocuWare user interfaces and API. An attacker can also gain privileges by modifying text. The default installation is unsafe because the server listens on the network interface, not the localhost interface.
      LAME 3.99.5 has a heap-based buffer over-read in fill_buffer in libmp3lame/util.c, related to lame_encode_buffer_sample_t in libmp3lame/lame.c, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-9410.

      The ZoomLauncher binary in the Zoom client for Linux before 2.0.115900.1201 does not properly sanitize user input when constructing a shell command, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the zoommtg:// scheme handler.
      Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 allow authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) URL value of an item or (2) user log history. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.
      TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control when requesting users.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to delete an arbitrary user (including admin), or modify attributes of any arbitrary user except administrator. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_user" on users.queries.php.
      TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control when requesting roles.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to modify any arbitrary roles within the application, or delete any arbitrary role. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_role" on roles.queries.php.
      An arbitrary file upload vulnerability, present in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9, allows remote authenticated users to upload arbitrary files leading to Remote Command Execution. To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker has to tamper with parameters of a request to upload.files.php, in order to select the correct branch and be able to upload any arbitrary file. From there, it can simply access the file to execute code on the server.
      TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce item access control when requesting items.queries.php. It is then possible to copy any arbitrary item into a directory controlled by the attacker, edit any item within a read-only directory, delete an arbitrary item, delete the file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy the password of an arbitrary item to the copy/paste buffer, access the history of an arbitrary item, and edit attributes of an arbitrary directory. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "item_id" parameter when invoking "copy_item" on items.queries.php.
      p_lx_elf.cpp in UPX 3.94 mishandles ELF headers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by an Invalid Pointer Read in PackLinuxElf64::unpack().
      There are CSRF vulnerabilities in Subrion CMS 4.1.x through 4.1.5, and before 4.2.0, because of a logic error. Although there is functionality to detect CSRF, it is called too late in the ia.core.php code, allowing (for example) an attack against the query parameter to panel/database.
      IBM Jazz Foundation Products could disclose sensitive information during a scan that could lead to further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 129619.
      The Smush Image Compression and Optimization plugin before 2.7.6 for WordPress allows directory traversal.

      plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.15.2 mishandles Distinguished Name (DN) fields, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) in situations involving untrusted X.509 data, related to the get_matching_data and X509_NAME_oneline_ex functions. NOTE: this has security relevance only in use cases outside of the MIT Kerberos distribution, e.g., the use of get_matching_data in KDC certauth plugin code that is specific to Red Hat.
      A flaw was found in GlusterFS in versions prior to 3.10. A null pointer dereference in send_brick_req function in glusterfsd/src/gf_attach.c may be used to cause denial of service.
      Invalid json_populate_recordset or jsonb_populate_recordset function calls in PostgreSQL 10.x before 10.1, 9.6.x before 9.6.6, 9.5.x before 9.5.10, 9.4.x before 9.4.15, and 9.3.x before 9.3.20 can crash the server or disclose a few bytes of server memory.
      INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE commands in PostgreSQL 10.x before 10.1, 9.6.x before 9.6.6, and 9.5.x before 9.5.10 disclose table contents that the invoker lacks privilege to read. These exploits affect only tables where the attacker lacks full read access but has both INSERT and UPDATE privileges. Exploits bypass row level security policies and lack of SELECT privilege.
      An attacker submitting facts to the Foreman server containing HTML can cause a stored XSS on certain pages: (1) Facts page, when clicking on the "chart" button and hovering over the chart; (2) Trends page, when checking the graph for a trend based on a such fact; (3) Statistics page, for facts that are aggregated on this page.
      The tower_probe function in drivers/usb/misc/legousbtower.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.1 allows local users (who are physically proximate for inserting a crafted USB device) to gain privileges by leveraging a write-what-where condition that occurs after a race condition and a NULL pointer dereference.

      An access flaw was found in Heketi 5, where the heketi.json configuration file was world readable. An attacker having local access to the Heketi server could read plain-text passwords from the heketi.json file.
      In Moodle 3.x, students can find out email addresses of other students in the same course. Using search on the Participants page, students could search email addresses of all participants regardless of email visibility. This allows enumerating and guessing emails of other students.
      When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates) to use the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority as all non-libvirtd services. As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes.
      The sctp_do_peeloff function in net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14 does not check whether the intended netns is used in a peel-off action, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls.
      The rngapi_reset function in crypto/rng.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).

      IBM Business Process Manager 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources. IBM X-Force ID: 130156.
      The PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729 server does not properly escape data before writing it into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. This can be used by attackers to hide data in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) view and create arbitrary entries to a certain extent. Special characters such as '"' and ',' and '\r' are not escaped and can be used to add new entries to the log.
      A use-after-free issue could be triggered remotely in the SFTP component of PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729. This issue could be triggered prior to authentication. The PSFTPd server did not automatically restart, which enabled attackers to perform a very effective DoS attack against this service. By sending a crafted SSH identification / version string to the server, a NULL pointer dereference could be caused, apparently because of a race condition in the window message handling, performing the cleanup for invalid connections. This incorrect cleanup code has a use-after-free.
      The PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729 server stores its configuration inside PSFTPd.dat. This file is a Microsoft Access Database and can be extracted. The application sets the encrypt flag with the password "ITsILLEGAL"; however, this password is not required to extract the data. Cleartext is used for a user password.
      Mahara 15.04 before 15.04.15, 16.04 before 16.04.9, 16.10 before 16.10.6, and 17.04 before 17.04.4 are vulnerable to a user submitting a potential dangerous payload, e.g., XSS code, to be saved as titles in internal artefacts.
      security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.5 does not consider the case of a NULL payload in conjunction with a nonzero length value, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted add_key or keyctl system call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-12192.
      Samba before 4.7.3 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging failure of the server to clear allocated heap memory.
      OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows an authenticated user to gain superuser privileges: Content Server allows uploading content using batches (TAR archives). When unpacking TAR archives, Content Server fails to verify the contents of an archive, which causes a path traversal vulnerability via symlinks. Because some files on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this leads to privilege escalation.
      ReadGIFImage in coders/gif.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 and GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 leaves the palette uninitialized when processing a GIF file that has neither a global nor local palette. If the affected product is used as a library loaded into a process that operates on interesting data, this data sometimes can be leaked via the uninitialized palette.
      Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was discovered in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of data (in /sources/folders.queries.php). An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

      Cross-Site Scripting exists in OctoberCMS 1.0.425 (aka Build 425), allowing a least privileged user to upload an SVG file containing malicious code as the Avatar for the profile. When this is opened by the Admin, it causes JavaScript execution in the context of the Admin account.
      X-Cart 5.2.23, 5.3.1.9, 5.3.2.13, and 5.3.3 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability exists because the application fails to check remote file extensions before saving locally. This vulnerability can be exploited by anyone with Vendor access or higher. One attack methodology is to upload an image file in the Attachments section of a product catalog, upload a .php file with an "Add File Via URL" action, and change the image's Description URL to reference the .php URL in the attachments/ directory.
      SQLite 3.20.1 has a NULL pointer dereference in tableColumnList in shell.c because it fails to consider certain cases where `sqlite3_step(pStmt)==SQLITE_ROW` is false and a data structure is never initialized.

      SAP Hostcontrol does not require authentication for the SOAP SAPControl endpoint. This is SAP Security Note 2442993.
      Git through 2.14.2 mishandles layers of tree objects, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted repository, aka a Git bomb. This can also have an impact of disk consumption; however, an affected process typically would not survive its attempt to build the data structure in memory before writing to disk.
      The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.13.7 mishandles use of add_key for a key that already exists but is uninstantiated, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted system call.
      IBM Business Process Manager 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X-Force ID: 130409.
      The miner statistics HTTP API in EWBF Cuda Zcash Miner Version 0.3.4b hangs on incoming TCP connections until some sort of request is made (such as "GET / HTTP/1.1"), which allows for a Denial of Service attack preventing a user from viewing their mining statistics by an attacker opening a session with telnet or netcat and connecting to the miner on the HTTP API port.
      In CPUID CPU-Z through 1.81, there are improper access rights to a kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz143_x64.sys for version 1.43) that can result in information disclosure or elevation of privileges, because of an arbitrary read of any physical address via ioctl 0x9C402604. Any application running on the system (Windows), including sandboxed users, can issue an ioctl to this driver without any validation. Furthermore, the driver can map any physical page on the system and returns the allocated map page address to the user: that results in an information leak and EoP. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the arbitrary read itself is intentional behavior (for ACPI scan functionality); the security issue is the lack of an ACL.
      In CPUID CPU-Z before 1.43, there is an arbitrary memory write that results directly in elevation of privileges, because any program running on the local machine (while CPU-Z is running) can issue an ioctl 0x9C402430 call to the kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz141_x64.sys for version 1.41).
      /bin/login.php in the Web Panel on the Airtame HDMI dongle with firmware before 3.0 allows an attacker to set his own session id via a "Cookie: PHPSESSID=" header. This can be used to achieve persistent access to the admin panel even after an admin password change.
      XSS exists in NexusPHP 1.5 via the keyword parameter to messages.php.
      The kvm_vm_ioctl_check_extension function in arch/powerpc/kvm/powerpc.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM ioctl call to /dev/kvm.

      In Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.4 (inclusive) the broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0 frames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate.  Older AMQP protocols are not affected.
      In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured with different authentication providers on different ports one of which is an HTTP port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using an authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.
      In Apache Struts 2.5 to 2.5.14, the REST Plugin is using an outdated JSON-lib library which is vulnerable and allow perform a DoS attack using malicious request with specially crafted JSON payload.

To mitigate the issue upgrading to 3.0.1 version is required. In Synapse 3.0.1 version, Commons Collection has been updated to 3.2.2 version which contains the fix for the above mentioned vulnerability.

      In TinyWebGallery v2.4, an XSS vulnerability is located in the `mkname`, `mkitem`, and `item` parameters of the `Add/Create` module. Remote attackers with low-privilege user accounts for backend access are able to inject malicious script codes into the `TWG Explorer` item listing. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the service. The injection point is the add/create input field and the execution point occurs in the item listing after the add or create.
      In Bludit v1.5.2 and v2.0.1, an XSS vulnerability is located in the new page, new category, and edit post function body message context. Remote attackers are able to bypass the basic editor validation to trigger cross site scripting. The XSS is persistent and the request method to inject via editor is GET. To save the editor context, the followup POST method request must be processed to perform the attack via the application side. The basic validation of the editor does not allow injecting script codes and blocks the context. Attackers can inject the code by using an editor tag that is not recognized by the basic validation. Thus allows a restricted user account to inject malicious script code to perform a persistent attack against higher privilege web-application user accounts.
      In Vectura Perfect Privacy VPN Manager v1.10.10 and v1.10.11, when resetting the network data via the software client, with a running VPN connection, a critical error occurs which leads to a "FrmAdvancedProtection" crash.

      The ZKTime Web Software 2.0.1.12280 allows the Administrator to elevate the privileges of the application user using a 'password_change()' function of the Modify Password component, reachable via the old_password, new_password1, and new_password2 parameters to the /accounts/password_change/ URI. An attacker takes advantage of this scenario and creates a crafted CSRF link to add himself as an administrator to the ZKTime Web Software. He then uses social engineering methods to trick the administrator into clicking the forged HTTP request. The request is executed and the attacker becomes the Administrator of the ZKTime Web Software. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, then an attacker (who would be a normal user of the web application) can escalate his privileges and become the administrator of ZKTime Web Software.
      There is a reflected XSS vulnerability in ZKTime Web 2.0.1.12280. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the 'Range' field of the 'Department' module in a Personnel Advanced Query.

      OpenAFS 1.x before 1.6.22 does not properly validate Rx ack packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash or application crash) via crafted fields, as demonstrated by an integer underflow and assertion failure for a small MTU value.
      The recv_files function in receiver.c in the daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, proceeds with certain file metadata updates before checking for a filename in the daemon_filter_list data structure, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
      The daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in "xname follows" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
      An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products, aka BlueSteal. An attacker can remotely unlock any safe in this product line without a valid PIN code. Even though the phone application requires it and there is a field to supply the PIN code in an authorization request, the safe does not check the PIN code, so an attacker can obtain authorization using any value. Once an attacker sees the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement for the safe, they need only to write a BLE characteristic to enable notifications, and send a crafted getAuthor packet that returns a temporary key, and an unlock packet including that temporary key. The safe then opens after the unlock packet is processed, with no verification of PIN or other credentials.
      An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products. There is no encryption of the session between the Android application and the safe. The website and marketing materials advertise that this communication channel is encrypted with "Highest Level Bluetooth Encryption" and "Data transmissions are secure via AES256 bit encryption." These claims, however, are not true. Moreover, AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, so it would have to be at the application level. This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe.
      In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to crash the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data fields for client name or realm. The parser would unconditionally dereference NULL pointers in that case, leading to a segmentation fault.

      net/netfilter/nfnetlink_cthelper.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for new, get, and del operations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the nfnl_cthelper_list data structure is shared across all net namespaces.
      The __netlink_deliver_tap_skb function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4, when CONFIG_NLMON is enabled, does not restrict observations of Netlink messages to a single net namespace, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to sniff an nlmon interface for all Netlink activity on the system.
      net/netfilter/xt_osf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for add_callback and remove_callback operations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the xt_osf_fingers data structure is shared across all net namespaces.

      An issue was discovered in Open-iSCSI through 2.0.875. A local attacker can cause the iscsiuio server to abort or potentially execute code by sending messages with incorrect lengths, which (due to lack of checking) can lead to buffer overflows, and result in aborts (with overflow checking enabled) or code execution. The process_iscsid_broadcast function in iscsiuio/src/unix/iscsid_ipc.c does not validate the payload length before a write operation.
      An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9 that allows remote attackers to trigger use of an intended public key for encryption, because incorrect regular expressions are used for extraction of an e-mail address from a comma-separated list, as demonstrated by a modified Full Name field and a homograph attack, aka TBE-01-002.
      An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. A remote attacker can obtain cleartext content by sending an encrypted data block (that the attacker cannot directly decrypt) to a victim, and relying on the victim to automatically decrypt that block and then send it back to the attacker as quoted text, aka the TBE-01-005 "replay" issue.
      An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. Improper Random Secret Generation occurs because Math.Random() is used by pretty Easy privacy (pEp), aka TBE-01-001.
      An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. Regular expressions are exploitable for Denial of Service, because of attempts to match arbitrarily long strings, aka TBE-01-003.
      An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. Signature spoofing is possible because the UI does not properly distinguish between an attachment signature, and a signature that applies to the entire containing message, aka TBE-01-021. This is demonstrated by an e-mail message with an attachment that is a signed e-mail message in message/rfc822 format.
      An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. In a variant of CVE-2017-17847, signature spoofing is possible for multipart/related messages because a signed message part can be referenced with a cid: URI but not actually displayed. In other words, the entire containing message appears to be signed, but the recipient does not see any of the signed text.
      A buffer overflow vulnerability in GetGo Download Manager 5.3.0.2712 and earlier could allow remote HTTP servers to execute arbitrary code on NAS devices via a long response.
      An issue was discovered in Asterisk 13.18.4 and older, 14.7.4 and older, 15.1.4 and older, and 13.18-cert1 and older. A select set of SIP messages create a dialog in Asterisk. Those SIP messages must contain a contact header. For those messages, if the header was not present and the PJSIP channel driver was used, Asterisk would crash. The severity of this vulnerability is somewhat mitigated if authentication is enabled. If authentication is enabled, a user would have to first be authorized before reaching the crash point.

      On Windows installations of the mcollective-puppet-agent plugin, version 1.12.0, a non-administrator user can create an executable that will be executed with administrator privileges on the next "mco puppet" run. Puppet Enterprise users are not affected. This is resolved in mcollective-puppet-agent 1.12.1.
      Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.
      Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 failed to mark MCollective server private keys as sensitive (a feature added in Puppet 4.6), so key values could be logged and stored in PuppetDB. These releases use the sensitive data type to ensure this won't happen anymore.
      Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format. This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which would lead to remote code execution. This change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML.
      The mcollective-sshkey-security plugin before 0.5.1 for Puppet uses a server-specified identifier as part of a path where a file is written. A compromised server could use this to write a file to an arbitrary location on the client with the filename appended with the string "_pub.pem".
      Versions of the puppetlabs-apache module prior to 1.11.1 and 2.1.0 make it very easy to accidentally misconfigure TLS trust. If you specify the `ssl_ca` parameter but do not specify the `ssl_certs_dir` parameter, a default will be provided for the `ssl_certs_dir` that will trust certificates from any of the system-trusted certificate authorities. This did not affect FreeBSD.

      On Juniper Networks devices running Junos OS affected versions and with LDP enabled, a specific LDP packet destined to the RE (Routing Engine) will consume a small amount of the memory allocated for the rpd (routing protocol daemon) process. Over time, repeatedly receiving this type of LDP packet(s) will cause the memory to exhaust and the rpd process to crash and restart. It is not possible to free up the memory that has been consumed without restarting the rpd process. This issue affects Junos OS based devices with either IPv4 or IPv6 LDP enabled via the [protocols ldp] configuration (the native IPv6 support for LDP is available in Junos OS 16.1 and higher). The interface on which the packet arrives needs to have LDP enabled. The affected Junos versions are: 13.3 prior to 13.3R10; 14.1 prior to 14.1R8; 14.2 prior to 14.2R7-S6 or 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S14, 15.1F6-S4, 15.1F7, 15.1R4-S7, 15.1R5; 15.1X49 before 15.1X49-D70; 15.1X53 before 15.1X53-D230, 15.1X53-D63, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 before 16.1R2. 16.2R1 and all subsequent releases have a resolution for this vulnerability.
      Juniper Networks devices running affected Junos OS versions may be impacted by the receipt of a crafted BGP UPDATE which can lead to an rpd (routing process daemon) crash and restart.

Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D40 on QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX10002, QFX10008, QFX10016, EX4600 and NFX250; 15.1 prior to 15.1R5 on EX4600; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D70 on vSRX, SRX1500, SRX4100, SRX4200; 16.1 prior to 16.1R2 on EX4600, ACX5000 series. This issue does not affect vMX. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
      MACsec feature on Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100 on SRX300 series does not report errors when a secure link can not be established. It falls back to an unencrypted link. This can happen when MACsec is configured on ports that are not capable of MACsec or when a secure link can not be established. This can mislead customers into believing that a link is secure. On SRX 300 series devices, prior to 15.1X49-D100, MACsec was only supported on control and fabric ports of SRX340 and SRX345 devices. SRX300 and and SRX320 did not have any MACsec capable ports. Configuring MACsec on ports that were not MACsec capable would have resulted in this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100 on SRX300 series.
      The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of "Status: Connected" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series. Devices on any version of Junos OS 12.1X46, or 12.1X47 are unaffected by this issue.
      A routine within an internal Junos OS sockets library is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Malicious exploitation of this issue may lead to a denial of service (kernel panic) or be leveraged as a privilege escalation through local code execution. The routines are only accessible via programs running on the device itself, and veriexec restricts arbitrary programs from running on Junos OS. There are no known exploit vectors utilizing signed binaries shipped with Junos OS itself. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D51, 12.3X48-D55; 13.3 prior to 13.3R10-S2; 14.1 prior to 14.1R2-S10, 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X50 prior to 14.1X50-D185; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D122, 14.1X53-D45, 14.1X53-D50; 14.2 prior to 14.2R4-S9, 14.2R7-S7, 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S18, 15.1F6-S7, 15.1R4-S8, 15.1R5-S5, 15.1R6-S1, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D231, 15.1X53-D47, 15.1X53-D48, 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D64, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 prior to 16.1R3-S4, 16.1R4-S3, 16.1R4-S4, 16.1R5; 16.2 prior to 16.2R2; 17.1 prior to 17.1R1-S3, 17.1R2; 17.2 prior to 17.2R1-S1, 17.2R2; 17.2X75 prior to 17.2X75-D30. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
      On Junos OS devices with SNMP enabled, a network based attacker with unfiltered access to the RE can cause the Junos OS snmpd daemon to crash and restart by sending a crafted SNMP packet. Repeated crashes of the snmpd daemon can result in a partial denial of service condition. Additionally, it may be possible to craft a malicious SNMP packet in a way that can result in remote code execution. SNMP is disabled in Junos OS by default. Junos OS devices with SNMP disabled are not affected by this issue. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.

      In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d, if a malicious server supplies bad parameters for a DHE or ECDHE key exchange then this can result in the client attempting to dereference a NULL pointer leading to a client crash. This could be exploited in a Denial of Service attack.
      If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.
      There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2k and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note: This issue is very similar to CVE-2015-3193 but must be treated as a separate problem.
      During a renegotiation handshake if the Encrypt-Then-Mac extension is negotiated where it was not in the original handshake (or vice-versa) then this can cause OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0e to crash (dependent on ciphersuite). Both clients and servers are affected.
      While parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, it is possible to do a one-byte overread. This would result in an incorrect text display of the certificate. This bug has been present since 2006 and is present in all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g.

This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.
      OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.
      There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.
      In Lenovo Active Protection System before 1.82.0.14, an attacker with local privileges could send commands to the system's embedded controller, which could cause a denial of service attack on the system or the ability to alter hardware functionality.

      An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security 4.2.0.RELEASE through 4.2.2.RELEASE, and Spring Security 5.0.0.M1. When configured to enable default typing, Jackson contained a deserialization vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting known "deserialization gadgets." Spring Security configures Jackson with global default typing enabled, which means that (through the previous exploit) arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is true: (1) Spring Security's Jackson support is being leveraged by invoking SecurityJackson2Modules.getModules(ClassLoader) or SecurityJackson2Modules.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper); (2) Jackson is used to deserialize data that is not trusted (Spring Security does not perform deserialization using Jackson, so this is an explicit choice of the user); and (3) there is an unknown (Jackson is not blacklisting it already) "deserialization gadget" that allows code execution present on the classpath. Jackson provides a blacklisting approach to protecting against this type of attack, but Spring Security should be proactive against blocking unknown "deserialization gadgets" when Spring Security enables default typing.

      Installing a zero-permission Android application on certain Samsung Android devices with KK(4.4), L(5.0/5.1), and M(6.0) software can continually crash the system_server process in the Android OS. The zero-permission app will create an active install session for a separate app that it has embedded within it. The active install session of the embedded app is performed using the android.content.pm.PackageInstaller class and its nested classes in the Android API. The active install session will write the embedded APK file to the /data/app directory, but the app will not be installed since third-party applications cannot programmatically install apps. Samsung has modified AOSP in order to accelerate the parsing of APKs by introducing the com.android.server.pm.PackagePrefetcher class and its nested classes. These classes will parse the APKs present in the /data/app directory and other directories, even if the app is not actually installed. The embedded APK that was written to the /data/app directory via the active install session has a very large but valid AndroidManifest.xml file. Specifically, the AndroidManifest.xml file contains a very large string value for the name of a permission-tree that it declares. When system_server tries to parse the APK file of the embedded app from the active install session, it will crash due to an uncaught error (i.e., java.lang.OutOfMemoryError) or an uncaught exception (i.e., std::bad_alloc) because of memory constraints. The Samsung Android device will encounter a soft reboot due to a system_server crash, and this action will keep repeating since parsing the APKs in the /data/app directory as performed by the system_server process is part of the normal boot process. The Samsung ID is SVE-2016-6917.
      A SQL Injection issue was discovered in SageCRM 7.x before 7.3 SP3. The AP_DocumentUI.asp web resource includes Utilityfuncs.js when the file is opened or viewed. This file crafts a SQL statement to identify the database that is to be in use with the current user's session. The database variable can be populated from the URL, and when supplied non-expected characters, can be manipulated to obtain access to the underlying database. The /CRM/CustomPages/ACCPAC/AP_DocumentUI.asp?SID=<VALID-SID>&database=1';WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'-- URI is a Proof of Concept.
      An issue was discovered in SageCRM 7.x before 7.3 SP3. The Component Manager functionality, provided by SageCRM, permits additional components to be added to the application to enhance provided functionality. This functionality allows a zip file to be uploaded, containing a valid .ecf component file, which will be extracted to the inf directory outside of the webroot. By creating a zip file containing an empty .ecf file, to pass file-validation checks, any other file provided in zip file will be extracted onto the filesystem. In this case, a web shell with the filename '..\WWWRoot\CustomPages\aspshell.asp' was included within the zip file that, when extracted, traversed back out of the inf directory and into the SageCRM webroot. This permitted remote interaction with the underlying filesystem with the highest privilege level, SYSTEM.
      An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.

      Biscom Secure File Transfer version 5.1.1015 (and possibly prior) is vulnerable to post-authentication persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in the "Name" and "Description" fields of a Workspace, as well as the "Description" field of a File Details pane of a file stored in a Workspace. This issue has been resolved in version 5.1.1025.
      The default SSH configuration in Rapid7 Nexpose hardware appliances shipped before June 2017 does not specify desired algorithms for key exchange and other important functions. As a result, it falls back to allowing ALL algorithms supported by the relevant version of OpenSSH and makes the installations vulnerable to a range of MITM, downgrade, and decryption attacks.
      Routes used to stop running Metasploit tasks (either particular ones or all tasks) allowed GET requests. Only POST requests should have been allowed, as the stop/stop_all routes change the state of the service. This could have allowed an attacker to stop currently-running Metasploit tasks by getting an authenticated user to execute JavaScript. As of Metasploit 4.14.0 (Update 2017061301), the routes for stopping tasks only allow POST requests, which validate the presence of a secret token to prevent CSRF attacks.
      Biscom Secure File Transfer is vulnerable to AngularJS expression injection in the Display Name field. An authenticated user can populate this field with a valid AngularJS expression, wrapped in double curly-braces ({{ }}). This expression will be evaluated by any other authenticated user who views the attacker's display name.
      Biscom Secure File Transfer is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in the File Name field. An authenticated user with permissions to upload or send files can populate this field with a filename that contains standard HTML scripting tags. The resulting script will evaluated by any other authenticated user who views the attacker-supplied file name.
      In version 3.5 and prior of Cambium Networks ePMP firmware, the non-administrative users 'installer' and 'home' have the capability of changing passwords for other accounts, including admin, after disabling a client-side protection mechanism.
      In version 3.5 and prior of Cambium Networks ePMP firmware, a lack of input sanitation for certain parameters on the web management console allows any authenticated user (including the otherwise low-privilege readonly user) to inject shell meta-characters as part of a specially-crafted POST request to the get_chart function and run OS-level commands, effectively as root.
      In version 3.5 and prior of Cambium Networks ePMP firmware, all authenticated users have the ability to update the Device Name and System Description fields in the web administration console, and those fields are vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) injection.

      An issue was discovered in dotCMS through 3.6.1. The findChildrenByFilter() function which is called by the web accessible path /categoriesServlet performs string interpolation and direct SQL query execution. SQL quote escaping and a keyword blacklist were implemented in a new class, SQLUtil (main/java/com/dotmarketing/common/util/SQLUtil.java), as part of the remediation of CVE-2016-8902; however, these can be overcome in the case of the q and inode parameters to the /categoriesServlet path. Overcoming these controls permits a number of blind boolean SQL injection vectors in either parameter. The /categoriesServlet web path can be accessed remotely and without authentication in a default dotCMS deployment.

      All versions of Quagga, 0.93 through 1.1.0, are vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation in the telnet 'vty' CLI, leading to a Denial-of-Service of Quagga daemons, or even the entire host. When Quagga daemons are configured with their telnet CLI enabled, anyone who can connect to the TCP ports can trigger this vulnerability, prior to authentication. Most distributions restrict the Quagga telnet interface to local access only by default. The Quagga telnet interface 'vty' input buffer grows automatically, without bound, so long as a newline is not entered. This allows an attacker to cause the Quagga daemon to allocate unbounded memory by sending very long strings without a newline. Eventually the daemon is terminated by the system, or the system itself runs out of memory. This is fixed in Quagga 1.1.1 and Free Range Routing (FRR) Protocol Suite 2017-01-10.

      An issue was discovered on NETGEAR R8500, R8300, R7000, R6400, R7300, R7100LG, R6300v2, WNDR3400v3, WNR3500Lv2, R6250, R6700, R6900, and R8000 devices. They are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted requests to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the remote management option is set, and can also be exploited given access to the router over LAN or WLAN. When trying to access the web panel, a user is asked to authenticate; if the authentication is canceled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is redirected to a page that exposes a password recovery token. If a user supplies the correct token to the page /passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and password recovery is not enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router. If password recovery is set the exploit will fail, as it will ask the user for the recovery questions that were previously set when enabling that feature. This is persistent (even after disabling the recovery option, the exploit will fail) because the router will ask for the security questions.
      Stack-based buffer overflow in MapServer before 6.0.6, 6.2.x before 6.2.4, 6.4.x before 6.4.5, and 7.0.x before 7.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via vectors involving WFS get feature requests.

      An issue was discovered on FiberHome Fengine S5800 switches V210R240. An unauthorized attacker can access the device's SSH service, using a password cracking tool to establish SSH connections quickly. This will trigger an increase in the SSH login timeout (each of the login attempts will occupy a connection slot for a longer time). Once this occurs, legitimate login attempts via SSH/telnet will be refused, resulting in a denial of service; you must restart the device.
      The main function in plistutil.c in libimobiledevice libplist through 1.12 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) via Apple Property List data that is too short.
      The freelist-randomization feature in mm/slab.c in the Linux kernel 4.8.x and 4.9.x before 4.9.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (duplicate freelist entries and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the selection of a large value for a random number.
      drivers/hid/hid-corsair.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.6 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
      drivers/net/ieee802154/atusb.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.6 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
      The klsi_105_get_line_state function in drivers/usb/serial/kl5kusb105.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 places uninitialized heap-memory contents into a log entry upon a failure to read the line status, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log.

      An issue was discovered in Zammad before 1.0.4, 1.1.x before 1.1.3, and 1.2.x before 1.2.1. Attackers can login with the hashed password itself (e.g., from the DB) instead of the valid password string.
      An XSS issue was discovered in Zammad before 1.0.4, 1.1.x before 1.1.3, and 1.2.x before 1.2.1. Attachments are opened in a new tab instead of getting downloaded. This creates an attack vector of executing code in the domain of the application.
      An issue was discovered in Zammad before 1.0.4, 1.1.x before 1.1.3, and 1.2.x before 1.2.1. XSS can be triggered via malicious HTML in a chat message or the content of a ticket article, when using either the REST API or the WebSocket API.
      With OxygenOS before 4.0.3, when a charger is connected to a powered-off OnePlus 3 or 3T device, the platform starts with adbd enabled. Therefore, a malicious charger or a physical attacker can open up, without authorization, an ADB session with the device, in order to further exploit other vulnerabilities and/or exfiltrate sensitive information.
      An issue was discovered in OxygenOS before 4.1.0 on OnePlus 3 and 3T devices. The attacker can change the bootmode of the device by issuing the 'fastboot oem boot_mode {rf/wlan/ftm/normal} command' in contradiction to the threat model of Android where the bootloader MUST NOT allow any security-sensitive operation to be run unless the bootloader is unlocked.
      An issue was discovered in OxygenOS before 4.0.3 for OnePlus 3 and 3T. The attacker can persistently make the (locked) bootloader start the platform with dm-verity disabled, by issuing the 'fastboot oem disable_dm_verity' command. Having dm-verity disabled, the kernel will not verify the system partition (and any other dm-verity protected partition), which may allow for persistent code execution and privilege escalation.
      In OxygenOS before 4.0.3 on OnePlus 3 and 3T devices, an unauthorized attacker can cause a locked bootloader to partially dump the ciphertext content of an arbitrary partition (except 'keystore') by issuing the 'fastboot oem dump <partition>' fastboot command.
      OxygenOS before version 4.0.2, on OnePlus 3 and 3T, has two hidden fastboot oem commands (4F500301 and 4F500302) that allow the attacker to lock/unlock the bootloader, disregarding the 'OEM Unlocking' checkbox, without user confirmation and without a factory reset. This allows for persistent code execution with high privileges (kernel/root) with complete access to user data.
      An issue was discovered in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before 4006739a28367c708dea19aeb19b8a1a9326ce08. The jsR_setproperty function in jsrun.c lacks a check for a negative array length. This leads to an integer overflow in the js_pushstring function in jsrun.c when parsing a specially crafted JS file.
      An issue was discovered in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before 8f62ea10a0af68e56d5c00720523ebcba13c2e6a. The MakeDay function in jsdate.c does not validate the month, leading to an integer overflow when parsing a specially crafted JS file.
      PECL in the download utility class in the Installer in PEAR Base System v1.10.1 does not validate file types and filenames after a redirect, which allows remote HTTP servers to overwrite files via crafted responses, as demonstrated by a .htaccess overwrite.
      An issue was discovered in KMCIS CaseAware. Reflected cross site scripting is present in the user parameter (i.e., "usr") that is transmitted in the login.php query string.
      An issue was discovered on the ASUS RT-N56U Wireless Router with Firmware 3.0.0.4.374_979. When executing an "nmap -O" command that specifies an IP address of an affected device, one can crash the device's WAN connection, causing disconnection from the Internet, a Denial of Service (DoS). The attack is only possible from within the local area network.
      Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities on the D-Link DI-524 Wireless Router with firmware 9.01 allow remote attackers to (1) change the admin password, (2) reboot the device, or (3) possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted requests to CGI programs.
      The Norwegian Air Shuttle (aka norwegian.com) airline kiosk allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the intended "Please select booking identification" UI step, and obtain administrative privileges and network access on the underlying Windows OS, by accessing a touch-screen print icon to manipulate the print dialog.
      In Apache NiFi before 0.7.2 and 1.x before 1.1.2 in a cluster environment, if an anonymous user request is replicated to another node, the originating node identity is used rather than the "anonymous" user.
      In Apache NiFi before 0.7.2 and 1.x before 1.1.2 in a cluster environment, the proxy chain serialization/deserialization is vulnerable to an injection attack where a carefully crafted username could impersonate another user and gain their permissions on a replicated request to another node.
      Two four letter word commands "wchp/wchc" are CPU intensive and could cause spike of CPU utilization on Apache ZooKeeper server if abused, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests. Apache ZooKeeper thru version 3.4.9 and 3.5.2 suffer from this issue, fixed in 3.4.10, 3.5.3, and later.
      The Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts 2 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 has incorrect exception handling and error-message generation during file-upload attempts, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted Content-Type, Content-Disposition, or Content-Length HTTP header, as exploited in the wild in March 2017 with a Content-Type header containing a #cmd= string.
      It was noticed that a malicious process impersonating an Impala daemon in Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 could cause Impala daemons to skip authentication checks when Kerberos is enabled (but TLS is not). If the malicious server responds with 'COMPLETE' before the SASL handshake has completed, the client will consider the handshake as completed even though no exchange of credentials has happened.
      During installation of Ambari 2.4.0 through 2.4.2, Ambari Server artifacts are not created with proper ACLs.
      Apache Camel's Validation Component is vulnerable against SSRF via remote DTDs and XXE.
      Apache POI in versions prior to release 3.15 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a specially crafted OOXML file, aka an XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attack.
      In Apache Log4j 2.x before 2.8.2, when using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.
      For versions of Apache Knox from 0.2.0 to 0.11.0 - an authenticated user may use a specially crafted URL to impersonate another user while accessing WebHDFS through Apache Knox. This may result in escalated privileges and unauthorized data access. While this activity is audit logged and can be easily associated with the authenticated user, this is still a serious security issue. All users are recommended to upgrade to the Apache Knox 0.12.0 release.
      A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18, 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42, 7.0.0 to 7.0.76, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.52, when send file was used, results in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the response for request C for request B and no response for request C.
      While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to application listeners in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.11, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.75 did not use the appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application.
      Apache Geode before 1.1.1, when a cluster has enabled security by setting the security-manager property, allows remote authenticated users with CLUSTER:READ but not DATA:READ permission to access the data browser page in Pulse and consequently execute an OQL query that exposes data stored in the cluster.
      In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.
      In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the refactoring of the HTTP connectors introduced a regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors and/or response mix-up.
      During a routine security analysis, it was found that one of the ports in Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 sent data in plaintext even when the cluster was configured to use TLS. The port in question was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class which did not use the appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was turned on. It was therefore possible for an adversary, with access to the network, to eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming from that port and view the data in plaintext.
      JAX-RS XML Security streaming clients in Apache CXF before 3.1.11 and 3.0.13 do not validate that the service response was signed or encrypted, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers.
      In Ambari 2.4.x (before 2.4.3) and Ambari 2.5.0, an authorized user of the Ambari Hive View may be able to gain unauthorized read access to files on the host where the Ambari server executes.

      Several REST service endpoints of Apache Archiva are not protected against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A malicious site opened in the same browser as the archiva site, may send an HTML response that performs arbitrary actions on archiva services, with the same rights as the active archiva session (e.g. administrator rights).
      Apache Traffic Server before 6.2.1 generates a coredump when there is a mismatch between content length and chunked encoding.
      In Apache FOP before 2.2, files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses FOP can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.
      In Apache Batik before 1.9, files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.
      In Apache Fineract 0.4.0-incubating, 0.5.0-incubating, and 0.6.0-incubating, an authenticated user with client/loan/center/staff/group read permissions is able to inject malicious SQL into SELECT queries. The 'sqlSearch' parameter on a number of endpoints is not sanitized and appended directly to the query.
      The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that, when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to 8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method.  JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.  (2) By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP method.  Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.

      The Symantec Messaging Gateway, when processing a specific email attachment, can allow a malformed or corrupted Word file with a potentially malicious macro through despite the administrator having the 'disarm' functionality enabled. This constitutes a 'bypass' of the disarm functionality resident to the application.
      The Symantec Messaging Gateway can encounter a file inclusion vulnerability, which is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. This file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.

      Multiple Access Control issues in Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 before CP 1746 allow an authenticated, remote user with low privileges like 'Reports Only' or 'Auditor' to change FTP Access Control Settings, create or modify reports, or upload an HTTPS Decryption Certificate and Private Key.
      Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 before CP 1746 mismanages certain key and certificate data. Per IWSVA documentation, by default, IWSVA acts as a private Certificate Authority (CA) and dynamically generates digital certificates that are sent to client browsers to complete a secure passage for HTTPS connections. It also allows administrators to upload their own certificates signed by a root CA. An attacker with low privileges can download the current CA certificate and Private Key (either the default ones or ones uploaded by administrators) and use those to decrypt HTTPS traffic, thus compromising confidentiality. Also, the default Private Key on this appliance is encrypted with a very weak passphrase. If an appliance uses the default Certificate and Private Key provided by Trend Micro, an attacker can simply download these and decrypt the Private Key using the default/weak passphrase.
      Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 before CP 1746 does not sanitize a rest/commonlog/report/template name field, which allows a 'Reports Only' user to inject malicious JavaScript while creating a new report. Additionally, IWSVA implements incorrect access control that allows any authenticated, remote user (even with low privileges like 'Auditor') to create or modify reports, and consequently take advantage of this XSS vulnerability. The JavaScript is executed when victims visit reports or auditlog pages.

      When adding a private file via the editor in Drupal 8.2.x before 8.2.7, the editor will not correctly check access for the file being attached, resulting in an access bypass.
      Some administrative paths in Drupal 8.2.x before 8.2.7 did not include protection for CSRF. This would allow an attacker to disable some blocks on a site. This issue is mitigated by the fact that users would have to know the block ID.
      A 3rd party development library including with Drupal 8 development dependencies is vulnerable to remote code execution. This is mitigated by the default .htaccess protection against PHP execution, and the fact that Composer development dependencies aren't normal installed. You might be vulnerable to this if you are running a version of Drupal before 8.2.2. To be sure you aren't vulnerable, you can remove the <siteroot>/vendor/phpunit directory from your production deployments

      Cisco Sourcefire Snort 3.0 before build 233 mishandles Ether Type Validation. Since valid ether type and IP protocol numbers do not overlap, Snort++ stores all protocol decoders in a single array. That makes it possible to craft packets that have IP protocol numbers in the ether type field which will confuse the Snort++ decoder. For example, an eth:llc:snap:icmp6 packet will cause a crash because there is no ip6 header with which to calculate the icmp6 checksum. Affected decoders include gre, llc, trans_bridge, ciscometadata, linux_sll, and token_ring. The fix adds a check in the packet manager to validate the ether type before indexing the decoder array. An out of range ether type will raise 116:473.

      ** DISPUTED ** BackBox Linux 4.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ksoftirqd CPU consumption) via a flood of packets with Martian source IP addresses (as defined in RFC 1812 section 5.3.7). This product enables net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians by default.  NOTE: the vendor reports "It has been proved that this vulnerability has no foundation and it is totally fake and based on false assumptions."
      D-Link DIR-615 HW: T1 FW:20.09 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This enables an attacker to perform an unwanted action on a wireless router for which the user/admin is currently authenticated, as demonstrated by changing the Security option from WPA2 to None, or changing the hiddenSSID parameter, SSID parameter, or a security-option password.
      OpenStack Horizon 9.x through 9.1.1, 10.x through 10.0.2, and 11.0.0 allows remote authenticated administrators to conduct XSS attacks via a crafted federation mapping.
      Incorrect interaction of the parse_packet() and parse_part_sign_sha256() functions in network.c in collectd 5.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) of a collectd instance (configured with "SecurityLevel None" and with empty "AuthFile" options) via a crafted UDP packet.
      Pixie 1.0.4 allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via the POST data in an admin/index.php?s=publish&x=filemanager request for a filename with a double extension, such as a .jpg.php file with Content-Type of image/jpeg.
      On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, if a victim logged in to the Router's Web Interface visits a malicious site from another Browser tab, the malicious site then can send requests to the victim's Router without knowing the credentials (CSRF). An attacker can host a page that sends a POST request to Form2File.htm that tries to upload Firmware to victim's Router. This causes the router to reboot/crash resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker may succeed in uploading malicious Firmware.
      On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, once authenticated, this device identifies the user based on the IP address of his machine. By spoofing the IP address belonging to the victim's host, an attacker might be able to take over the administrative session without being prompted for authentication credentials. An attacker can get the victim's and router's IP addresses by simply sniffing the network traffic. Moreover, if the victim has web access enabled on his router and is accessing the web interface from a different network that is behind the NAT/Proxy, an attacker can sniff the network traffic to know the public IP address of the victim's router and take over his session as he won't be prompted for credentials.
      The D-Link DIR-615 device before v20.12PTb04 doesn't use SSL for any of the authenticated pages. Also, it doesn't allow the user to generate his own SSL Certificate. An attacker can simply monitor network traffic to steal a user's credentials and/or credentials of users being added while sniffing the traffic.

      The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time (aka backintime) 1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit authorization method (unix-process) that is subject to a race condition (time of check, time of use). With this authorization method, the owner of a process requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd via /proc/<pid>/status, by which time the requesting process may have been replaced by a different process with the same PID that has different privileges then the original requester.
      Schneider Electric SoMachine Basic 1.4 SP1 and Schneider Electric Modicon TM221CE16R 1.3.3.3 devices have a hardcoded-key vulnerability. The Project Protection feature is used to prevent unauthorized users from opening an XML protected project file, by prompting the user for a password. This XML file is AES-CBC encrypted; however, the key used for encryption (SoMachineBasicSoMachineBasicSoMa) cannot be changed. After decrypting the XML file with this key, the user password can be found in the decrypted data. After reading the user password, the project can be opened and modified with the Schneider product.
      Schneider Electric Modicon TM221CE16R 1.3.3.3 devices allow remote attackers to discover the application-protection password via a \x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x05\x01\x5a\x00\x03\x00 request to the Modbus port (502/tcp). Subsequently the application may be arbitrarily downloaded, modified, and uploaded.
      DragonWave Horizon 1.01.03 wireless radios have hardcoded login credentials (such as the username of energetic and password of wireless) meant to allow the vendor to access the devices.

      Foscam networked devices use the same hardcoded SSL private key across different customers' installations, which allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation.
      The network enabled distribution of Kura before 2.1.0 takes control over the device's firewall setup but does not allow IPv6 firewall rules to be configured. Still the Equinox console port 5002 is left open, allowing to log into Kura without any user credentials over unencrypted telnet and executing commands using the Equinox "exec" command. As the process is running as "root" full control over the device can be acquired. IPv6 is also left in auto-configuration mode, accepting router advertisements automatically and assigns a MAC address based IPv6 address.
      In Mosquitto before 1.4.12, pattern based ACLs can be bypassed by clients that set their username/client id to '#' or '+'. This allows locally or remotely connected clients to access MQTT topics that they do have the rights to. The same issue may be present in third party authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.
      A maliciously constructed HTTP/2 request could cause mod_http2 2.4.24, 2.4.25 to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the server process.
      Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or "HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.
      Apache CXF Fediz ships with a number of container-specific plugins to enable WS-Federation for applications. A CSRF (Cross Style Request Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in the Spring 2, Spring 3, Jetty 8 and Jetty 9 plugins in Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.0, 1.3.2 and 1.2.4.
      Apache CXF Fediz ships with an OpenId Connect (OIDC) service which has a Client Registration Service, which is a simple web application that allows clients to be created, deleted, etc. A CSRF (Cross Style Request Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in this web application in Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.0 and 1.3.2, meaning that a malicious web application could create new clients, or reset secrets, etc, after the admin user has logged on to the client registration service and the session is still active.
      Both global and Room chat are vulnerable to XSS attack in Apache OpenMeetings 3.2.0.
      Uploaded XML documents were not correctly validated in Apache OpenMeetings 3.1.0.
      In Apache NiFi before 0.7.4 and 1.x before 1.3.0, there are certain user input components in the UI which had been guarding for some forms of XSS issues but were insufficient.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, XSS attacks, click-jacking, and MIME based attacks.
      Apache NiFi before 0.7.4 and 1.x before 1.3.0 need to establish the response header telling browsers to only allow framing with the same origin.
      The HTTP strict parsing changes added in Apache httpd 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.
      In Apache Hadoop 2.8.0, 3.0.0-alpha1, and 3.0.0-alpha2, the LinuxContainerExecutor runs docker commands as root with insufficient input validation. When the docker feature is enabled, authenticated users can run commands as root.
      The Traffic Router component of the incubating Apache Traffic Control project is vulnerable to a Slowloris style Denial of Service attack. TCP connections made on the configured DNS port will remain in the ESTABLISHED state until the client explicitly closes the connection or Traffic Router is restarted. If connections remain in the ESTABLISHED state indefinitely and accumulate in number to match the size of the thread pool dedicated to processing DNS requests, the thread pool becomes exhausted. Once the thread pool is exhausted, Traffic Router is unable to service any DNS request, regardless of transport protocol.
      If an application allows enter an URL in a form field and built-in URLValidator is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which will be used to overload server process when performing validation of the URL. Solution is to upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.5.12.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 uses not very strong cryptographic storage, captcha is not used in registration and forget password dialogs and auth forms missing brute force protection.
      The CORS Filter in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21, 8.5.0 to 8.5.15, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.44 and 7.0.41 to 7.0.78 did not add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin. This permitted client and server side cache poisoning in some circumstances.
      The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.15 bypassed a number of security checks that prevented directory traversal attacks. It was therefore possible to bypass security constraints using a specially crafted URL.
      Policy resource matcher in Apache Ranger before 0.7.1 ignores characters after '*' wildcard character - like my*test, test*.txt. This can result in unintended behavior.
      In environments that use external location for hive tables, Hive Authorizer in Apache Ranger before 0.7.1 should be checking RWX permission for create table.
      In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.
      In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_mime can read one byte past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type response header.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 has an overly permissive crossdomain.xml file. This allows for flash content to be loaded from untrusted domains.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows authenticated users to modify the structure of the existing query and leak the structure of other queries being made by the application in the back-end.
      Apache OpenMeetings 3.2.0 is vulnerable to parameter manipulation attacks, as a result attacker has access to restricted areas.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 displays Tomcat version and detailed error stack trace, which is not secure.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 doesn't check contents of files being uploaded. An attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading multiple large files to the server.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 responds to the following insecure HTTP methods: PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and PATCH.
      Apache Ignite 1.0.0-RC3 to 2.0 uses an update notifier component to update the users about new project releases that include additional functionality, bug fixes and performance improvements. To do that the component communicates to an external PHP server (http://ignite.run) where it needs to send some system properties like Apache Ignite or Java version. Some of the properties might contain user sensitive information.
      When handling a decoding failure for a malformed URL path of an HTTP request, libprocess in Apache Mesos before 1.1.3, 1.2.x before 1.2.2, 1.3.x before 1.3.1, and 1.4.0-dev might crash because the code accidentally calls inappropriate function. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.
      Apache OpenMeetings 1.0.0 updates user password in insecure manner.
      A Command Injection vulnerability in Schneider Electric homeLYnk Controller exists in all versions before 1.5.0.
      Proxifier for Mac before 2.19.2, when first run, allows local users to gain privileges by replacing the KLoader binary with a Trojan horse program.
      A code injection vulnerability exists in SAP TREX / Business Warehouse Accelerator (BWA). The vendor response is SAP Security Note 2419592.
      SquirrelMail 1.4.22 (and other versions before 20170427_0200-SVN) allows post-authentication remote code execution via a sendmail.cf file that is mishandled in a popen call. It's possible to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the remote server. The problem is in the Deliver_SendMail.class.php with the initStream function that uses escapeshellcmd() to sanitize the sendmail command before executing it. The use of escapeshellcmd() is not correct in this case since it doesn't escape whitespaces, allowing the injection of arbitrary command parameters. The problem is in -f$envelopefrom within the sendmail command line. Hence, if the target server uses sendmail and SquirrelMail is configured to use it as a command-line program, it's possible to trick sendmail into using an attacker-provided configuration file that triggers the execution of an arbitrary command. For exploitation, the attacker must upload a sendmail.cf file as an email attachment, and inject the sendmail.cf filename with the -C option within the "Options > Personal Informations > Email Address" setting.
      Directory traversal vulnerability in viewer_script.jsp in Riverbed OPNET App Response Xpert (ARX) version 9.6.1 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary commands to read OS files.

      In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the NetScaler file parser could go into an infinite loop, triggered by a malformed capture file. This was addressed in wiretap/netscaler.c by ensuring a nonzero record size.
      In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the BGP dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bgp.c by using a different integer data type.
      In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the WBXML dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding length validation.
      In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the IMAP dissector could crash, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-imap.c by calculating a line's end correctly.
      In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5, the DOF dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dof.c by using a different integer data type and adjusting a return value.
      In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the RPC over RDMA dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-rpcrdma.c by correctly checking for going beyond the maximum offset.
      The read_u32_leb128 function in libr/util/uleb128.c in radare2 1.3.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted Web Assembly file.

      D-Link DCS-936L devices with firmware before 1.05.07 have an inadequate CSRF protection mechanism that requires the device's IP address to be a substring of the HTTP Referer header.
      D-Link DCS cameras have a weak/insecure CrossDomain.XML file that allows sites hosting malicious Flash objects to access and/or change the device's settings via a CSRF attack. This is because of the 'allow-access-from domain' child element set to *, thus accepting requests from any domain. If a victim logged into the camera's web console visits a malicious site hosting a malicious Flash file from another Browser tab, the malicious Flash file then can send requests to the victim's DCS series Camera without knowing the credentials. An attacker can host a malicious Flash file that can retrieve Live Feeds or information from the victim's DCS series Camera, add new admin users, or make other changes to the device. Known affected devices are DCS-933L with firmware before 1.13.05, DCS-5030L, DCS-5020L, DCS-2530L, DCS-2630L, DCS-930L, DCS-932L, and DCS-932LB1.

      WatchGuard Fireware allows user enumeration, e.g., in the Firebox XML-RPC login handler. A login request that contains a blank password sent to the XML-RPC agent in Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier returns different responses for valid and invalid usernames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to enumerate valid usernames on an affected Firebox.
      WatchGuard Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier mishandles requests referring to an XML External Entity (XXE), in the XML-RPC agent. This causes the Firebox wgagent process to crash. This process crash ends all authenticated sessions to the Firebox, including management connections, and prevents new authenticated sessions until the process has recovered. The Firebox may also experience an overall degradation in performance while the wgagent process recovers. An attacker could continuously send XML-RPC requests that contain references to external entities to perform a limited Denial of Service (DoS) attack against an affected Firebox.

      gnome-shell 3.22 through 3.24.1 mishandles extensions that fail to reload, which can lead to leaving extensions enabled in the lock screen. With these extensions, a bystander could launch applications (but not interact with them), see information from the extensions (e.g., what applications you have opened or what music you were playing), or even execute arbitrary commands. It all depends on what extensions a user has enabled. The problem is caused by lack of exception handling in js/ui/extensionSystem.js.

      WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.

      Elastic X-Pack Security versions 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 contain a privilege escalation bug in the run_as functionality. This bug prevents transitioning into the specified user specified in a run_as request. If a role has been created using a template that contains the _user properties, the behavior of run_as will be incorrect. Additionally if the run_as user specified does not exist, the transition will not happen.
      Kibana version 5.4.0 was affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) bug in the Time Series Visual Builder. This bug could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from Kibana users.
      Starting in version 5.3.0, Kibana had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Discover page that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.
      Elastic X-Pack Security versions prior to 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 did not always correctly apply Document Level Security to index aliases. This bug could allow a user with restricted permissions to view data they should not have access to when performing certain operations against an index alias.
      Elasticsearch X-Pack Security versions 5.0.0 to 5.4.3, when enabled, can result in the Elasticsearch _nodes API leaking sensitive configuration information, such as the paths and passphrases of SSL keys that were configured as part of an authentication realm. This could allow an authenticated Elasticsearch user to improperly view these details.
      In Kibana X-Pack security versions prior to 5.4.3 if a Kibana user opens a crafted Kibana URL the result could be a redirect to an improperly initialized Kibana login screen. If the user enters credentials on this screen, the credentials will appear in the URL bar. The credentials could then be viewed by untrusted parties or logged into the Kibana access logs.
      The client-forwarder in Elastic Cloud Enterprise versions prior to 1.0.2 do not properly encrypt traffic to ZooKeeper. If an attacker is able to man in the middle (MITM) the traffic between the client-forwarder and ZooKeeper they could potentially obtain sensitive data.
      An error was found in the X-Pack Security TLS trust manager for versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.1. If reloading the trust material fails the trust manager will be replaced with an instance that trusts all certificates. This could allow any node using any certificate to join a cluster. The proper behavior in this instance is for the TLS trust manager to deny all certificates.
      The Reporting feature in X-Pack in versions prior to 5.5.2 and standalone Reporting plugin versions versions prior to 2.4.6 had an impersonation vulnerability. A user with the reporting_user role could execute a report with the permissions of another reporting user, possibly gaining access to sensitive data.
      An error was found in the X-Pack Security 5.3.0 to 5.5.2 privilege enforcement. If a user has either 'delete' or 'index' permissions on an index in a cluster, they may be able to issue both delete and index requests against that index.
      An error was found in the permission model used by X-Pack Alerting 5.0.0 to 5.6.0 whereby users mapped to certain built-in roles could create a watch that results in that user gaining elevated privileges.
      X-Pack Security 5.2.x would allow access to more fields than the user should have seen if the field level security rules used a mix of grant and exclude rules when merging multiple rules with field level security rules for the same index.
      X-Pack 5.1.1 did not properly apply document and field level security to multi-search and multi-get requests so users without access to a document and/or field may have been able to access this information.
      With X-Pack installed, Kibana versions before 5.3.1 have an open redirect vulnerability on the login page that would enable an attacker to craft a link that redirects to an arbitrary website.
      Kibana versions prior to 5.2.1 configured for SSL client access, file descriptors will fail to be cleaned up after certain requests and will accumulate over time until the process crashes.

      An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices. Due to a lenient updater-script in the OnePlus OTA images, and the fact that both ROMs use the same OTA verification keys, attackers can install HydrogenOS over OxygenOS and vice versa, even on locked bootloaders, which allows for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, physical attackers can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).
      An issue was discovered on OnePlus One and X devices. Due to a lenient updater-script on the OnePlus One and X OTA images, the fact that both products use the same OTA verification keys, and the fact that both products share the same 'ro.build.product' system property, attackers can install OTAs of one product over the other, even on locked bootloaders. That could theoretically allow for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. Moreover, the vulnerability may result in having the device unusable until a Factory Reset is performed.

      A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned strlen(buf). If the content->type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the content->prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii) content->name is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the content->name actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write about "size" many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.
      libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.

      An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. By connecting to the Mosquitto broker on an access point and one of its clients, an attacker can gather enough information to craft a command that reboots the client remotely when sent to the client's Mosquitto broker, aka "unauthenticated remote command execution." This command can be re-sent endlessly to act as a DoS attack on the client.
      A hard-coded credentials issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3, Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3, and Mimosa Access Points before 2.2.3. These devices run Mosquitto, a lightweight message broker, to send information between devices. By using the vendor's hard-coded credentials to connect to the broker on any device (whether it be an AP, Client, or Backhaul model), an attacker can view all the messages being sent between the devices. If an attacker connects to an AP, the AP will leak information about any clients connected to it, including the serial numbers, which can be used to remotely factory reset the clients via a page in their web interface.
      An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, after logging in, there is a page that allows you to ping other hosts from the device and view the results. The user is allowed to specify which host to ping, but this variable is not sanitized server-side, which allows an attacker to pass a specially crafted string to execute shell commands as the root user.
      An information-leakage issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. There is a page in the web interface that will show you the device's serial number, regardless of whether or not you have logged in. This information-leakage issue is relevant because there is another page (accessible without any authentication) that allows you to remotely factory reset the device simply by entering the serial number.
      An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.4 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.4. On the backend of the device's web interface, there are some diagnostic tests available that are not displayed on the webpage; these are only accessible by crafting a POST request with a program like cURL. There is one test accessible via cURL that does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to execute shell commands as the root user.
      An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, there is a page that allows an attacker to use an unsanitized GET parameter to download files from the device as the root user. The attacker can download any file from the device's filesystem. This can be used to view unsalted, MD5-hashed administrator passwords, which can then be cracked, giving the attacker full admin access to the device's web interface. This vulnerability can also be used to view the plaintext pre-shared key (PSK) for encrypted wireless connections, or to view the device's serial number (which allows an attacker to factory reset the device).
      Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 wireless radios through 7.2.0 have a default password of mateidu for the mateidu account (a hidden user account established by the vendor). This account can be accessed via both the web interface and SSH. In the web interface, this simply grants an attacker read-only access to the device's settings. However, when using SSH, this gives an attacker access to a Linux shell. NOTE: the vendor has commented "The mateidu user is a known user, which is mentioned in the FibeAir IP-10 User Guide. Customers are instructed to change the mateidu user password. Changing the user password fully solves the vulnerability."
      There is a debug-interface vulnerability on some Tenda routers (FH1202/F1202/F1200: versions before 1.2.0.20). After connecting locally to a router in a wired or wireless manner, one can bypass intended access restrictions by sending shell commands directly and reading their results, or by entering shell commands that change this router's username and password.
      There is a stack-based buffer overflow on some Tenda routers (FH1202/F1202/F1200: versions before 1.2.0.20). Crafted POST requests to an unspecified URL result in DoS, interrupting the HTTP service (used to login to the web UI of a router) for 1 to 2 seconds.

      bfd/vms-alpha.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file in the _bfd_vms_get_value and _bfd_vms_slurp_etir functions during "objdump -D" execution.
      The versados_mkobject function in bfd/versados.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
      The process_otr function in bfd/versados.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, does not validate a certain offset, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
      opcodes/i386-dis.c in GNU Binutils 2.28 does not consider the number of registers for bnd mode, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
      The aarch64_ext_ldst_reglist function in opcodes/aarch64-dis.c in GNU Binutils 2.28 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.

      Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MetInfo 5.3.17 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the Client-IP or X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to /include/stat/stat.php in a para action.
      Integer overflow in the soap_get function in Genivia gSOAP 2.7.x and 2.8.x before 2.8.48, as used on Axis cameras and other devices, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a large XML document, aka Devil's Ivy. NOTE: the large document would be blocked by many common web-server configurations on general-purpose computers.
      In Wireshark 2.2.7, PROFINET IO data with a high recursion depth allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion) in the dissect_IODWriteReq function in plugins/profinet/packet-dcerpc-pn-io.c.

      GNU Debugger (GDB) 8.0 and earlier fails to detect a negative length field in a DWARF section. A malformed section in an ELF binary or a core file can cause GDB to repeatedly allocate memory until a process limit is reached. This can, for example, impede efforts to analyze malware with GDB.
      OCaml compiler allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9772 "but with much less impact."
      In Flatpak before 0.8.7, a third-party app repository could include malicious apps that contain files with inappropriate permissions, for example setuid or world-writable. The files are deployed with those permissions, which would let a local attacker run the setuid executable or write to the world-writable location. In the case of the "system helper" component, files deployed as part of the app are owned by root, so in the worst case they could be setuid root.
      A cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Check_MK versions 1.4.0x prior to 1.4.0p6, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript via the _username parameter when attempting authentication to webapi.py, which is returned unencoded with content type text/html.

      Csrf.cs in NancyFX Nancy before 1.4.4 and 2.x before 2.0-dangermouse has Remote Code Execution via Deserialization of JSON data in a CSRF Cookie.
      When using a Spring AOP functionality to secure Struts actions it is possible to perform a DoS attack. Solution is to upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.5.12 or 2.3.33.
      In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.
      When under stress, closing many connections, the HTTP/2 handling code in Apache httpd 2.4.26 would sometimes access memory after it has been freed, resulting in potentially erratic behaviour.
      When handling a libprocess message wrapped in an HTTP request, libprocess in Apache Mesos before 1.1.3, 1.2.x before 1.2.2, 1.3.x before 1.3.1, and 1.4.0-dev crashes if the request path is empty, because the parser assumes the request path always starts with '/'. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.
      The Struts 1 plugin in Apache Struts 2.3.x might allow remote code execution via a malicious field value passed in a raw message to the ActionMessage.
      In Apache Impala (incubating) before 2.10.0, a malicious user with "ALTER" permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table data by altering the table properties to make it "external" and then changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables. This violates and works around the authorization requirement that creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an "ALL" privilege at the server scope. This privilege requirement for "CREATE" commands is enforced to precisely avoid this scenario where a malicious user can change the underlying Kudu table mapping. The fix is to enforce the same privilege requirement for "ALTER" commands that would make existing non-external Kudu tables external.
      The REST Plugin in Apache Struts 2.3.7 through 2.3.33 and 2.5 through 2.5.12 is using an outdated XStream library which is vulnerable and allow perform a DoS attack using malicious request with specially crafted XML payload.
      When a cluster is operating in secure mode, a user with read privileges for specific data regions can use the gfsh command line utility to execute queries. In Apache Geode before 1.2.1, the query results may contain data from another user's concurrently executing gfsh query, potentially revealing data that the user is not authorized to view.
      When an Apache Geode cluster before v1.2.1 is operating in secure mode, an unauthenticated client can enter multi-user authentication mode and send metadata messages. These metadata operations could leak information about application data types. In addition, an attacker could perform a denial of service attack on the cluster.
      Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
      It was found that under some situations and configurations of Apache Storm 1.x before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1, it is theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised.
      A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients before 1.8.19, 1.9.x before 1.9.7, and 1.10.0.x through 1.10.0-alpha3 to run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to attack another user of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server. The vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://, http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.
      When a call-site passes a subject for an email that contains line-breaks in Apache Commons Email 1.0 through 1.4, the caller can add arbitrary SMTP headers.
      The Javascript method Sling.evalString() in Apache Sling Servlets Post before 2.3.22 uses the javascript 'eval' function to parse input strings, which allows for XSS attacks by passing specially crafted input strings.
      Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application. There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider). Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster. The vulnerability is fixed from Solr 6.6.1 onwards.
      In Apache Struts 2.3.7 through 2.3.33 and 2.5 through 2.5.12, if an application allows entering a URL in a form field and built-in URLValidator is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which will be used to overload server process when performing validation of the URL.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for S2-047 / CVE-2017-7672.
      The REST Plugin in Apache Struts 2.1.2 through 2.3.x before 2.3.34 and 2.5.x before 2.5.13 uses an XStreamHandler with an instance of XStream for deserialization without any type filtering, which can lead to Remote Code Execution when deserializing XML payloads.
      A vulnerability in the OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser before 4.1.4, and specifically in the WW8Fonts Constructor, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.
      An issue was discovered in the OpenWebif plugin through 1.2.4 for E2 open devices. The saveConfig function of "plugin/controllers/models/config.py" performs an eval() call on the contents of the "key" HTTP GET parameter. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary Python code or OS commands via api/saveconfig.
      There are no Anti-CSRF tokens in any forms on the web interface in Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server before Maintenance Pack 2 Critical Fix 4 (version 8.0.4.312). This would allow an attacker to submit authenticated requests when an authenticated user browses an attacker-controlled domain.
      The kluser is able to interact with the kav4fs-control binary in Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server before Maintenance Pack 2 Critical Fix 4 (version 8.0.4.312). By abusing the quarantine read and write operations, it is possible to elevate the privileges to root.
      The reportId parameter of the getReportStatus action method can be abused in the web interface in Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server before Maintenance Pack 2 Critical Fix 4 (version 8.0.4.312) to read arbitrary files with kluser privileges.
      In Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server before Maintenance Pack 2 Critical Fix 4 (version 8.0.4.312), the scriptName parameter of the licenseKeyInfo action method is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

      '/cgi-bin/admin/testserver.cgi' of the web service in most of the VIVOTEK Network Cameras is vulnerable to shell command injection, which allows remote attackers to execute any shell command as root via a crafted HTTP request. This vulnerability is already verified on VIVOTEK Network Camera IB8369/FD8164/FD816BA; most others have similar firmware that may be affected. An attack uses shell metacharacters in the senderemail parameter.
      '/cgi-bin/admin/downloadMedias.cgi' of the web service in most of the VIVOTEK Network Cameras is vulnerable, which allows remote attackers to read any file on the camera's Linux filesystem via a crafted HTTP request containing ".." sequences. This vulnerability is already verified on VIVOTEK Network Camera IB8369/FD8164/FD816BA; most others have similar firmware that may be affected.
      Remote Code Execution is possible in Code42 CrashPlan 5.4.x via the org.apache.commons.ssl.rmi.DateRMI Java class, because (upon instantiation) it creates an RMI server that listens on a TCP port and deserializes objects sent by TCP clients.
      An integer overflow vulnerability in the ptp_unpack_EOS_CustomFuncEx function of the ptp-pack.c file of libmtp (version 1.1.12 and below) allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) or maybe remote code execution by inserting a mobile device into a personal computer through a USB cable.
      An integer overflow vulnerability in ptp-pack.c (ptp_unpack_OPL function) of libmtp (version 1.1.12 and below) allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) or maybe remote code execution by inserting a mobile device into a personal computer through a USB cable.
      /cgi-bin/wapopen in BOA Webserver 0.94.14rc21 allows the injection of "../.." using the FILECAMERA variable (sent by GET) to read files with root privileges.

      The gs_alloc_ref_array function in psi/ialloc.c in Artifex Ghostscript 9.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PostScript document. This is related to a lack of an integer overflow check in base/gsalloc.c.
      Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Piwigo 2.9.1 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the virtual_name parameter to /admin.php (i.e., creating a virtual album).
      Dolibarr ERP/CRM 5.0.3 and prior allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types, which can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.
      Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php in PHPUnit before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via HTTP POST data beginning with a "<?php " substring, as demonstrated by an attack on a site with an exposed /vendor folder, i.e., external access to the /vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php URI.

      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sending nonsense data or setting up a TELNET session to the database port of Sunny Explorer, the application can be crashed. NOTE: the vendor reports that the maximum possible damage is a communication failure. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An Incorrect Password Management issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Default passwords exist that are rarely changed. User passwords will almost always be default. Installer passwords are expected to be default or similar across installations installed by the same company (but are sometimes changed). Hidden user accounts have (at least in some cases, though more research is required to test this for all hidden user accounts) a fixed password for all devices; it can never be changed by a user. Other vulnerabilities exist that allow an attacker to get the passwords of these hidden user accounts. NOTE: the vendor reports that it has no influence on the allocation of passwords, and that global hardcoded master passwords do not exist. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. All inverters have a very weak password policy for the user and installer password. No complexity requirements or length requirements are set. Also, strong passwords are impossible due to a maximum of 12 characters and a limited set of characters. NOTE: the vendor reports that the 12-character limit provides "a very high security standard." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sniffing for specific packets on the localhost, plaintext passwords can be obtained as they are typed into Sunny Explorer by the user. These passwords can then be used to compromise the overall device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation likelihood is low because these packets are usually sent only once during installation. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. A secondary authentication system is available for Installers called the Grid Guard system. This system uses predictable codes, and a single Grid Guard code can be used on any SMA inverter. Any such code, when combined with the installer account, allows changing very sensitive parameters. NOTE: the vendor reports that Grid Guard is not an authentication feature; it is only a tracing feature. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Sniffed passwords from SMAdata2+ communication can be decrypted very easily. The passwords are "encrypted" using a very simple encryption algorithm. This enables an attacker to find the plaintext passwords and authenticate to the device. NOTE: the vendor reports that only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SMAdata2+ communication protocol does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to man in the middle, packet injection, and replay attacks. Any setting change, authentication packet, scouting packet, etc. can be replayed, injected, or used for a man in the middle session. All functionalities available in Sunny Explorer can effectively be done from anywhere within the network as long as an attacker gets the packet setup correctly. This includes the authentication process for all (including hidden) access levels and the changing of settings in accordance with the gained access rights. Furthermore, because the SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sending crafted packets to an inverter and observing the response, active and inactive user accounts can be determined. This aids in further attacks (such as a brute force attack) as one now knows exactly which users exist and which do not. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this "is not a security gap per se." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The inverters make use of a weak hashing algorithm to encrypt the password for REGISTER requests. This hashing algorithm can be cracked relatively easily. An attacker will likely be able to crack the password using offline crackers. This cracked password can then be used to register at the SMA servers. NOTE: the vendor's position is that "we consider the probability of the success of such manipulation to be extremely low." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network protocol to update the device firmware without ever having to authenticate. If an attacker is able to create a custom firmware version that is accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised completely. This allows the attacker to do nearly anything: for example, giving access to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the inverters as a stepping stone into companies, etc. NOTE: the vendor reports that this attack has always been blocked by "a final integrity and compatibility check." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. When signed into Sunny Explorer with a wrong password, it is possible to create a debug report, disclosing information regarding the application and allowing the attacker to create and save a .txt file with contents to his liking. An attacker may use this for information disclosure, or to write a file to normally unavailable locations on the local system. NOTE: the vendor reports that "the information contained in the debug report is of marginal significance." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. If a user simultaneously has Sunny Explorer running and visits a malicious host, cross-site request forgery can be used to change settings in the inverters (for example, issuing a POST request to change the user password). All Sunny Explorer settings available to the authenticated user are also available to the attacker. (In some cases, this also includes changing settings that the user has no access to.) This may result in complete compromise of the device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation is unlikely because Sunny Explorer is used only rarely. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. An attacker can change the plant time even when not authenticated in any way. This changes the system time, possibly affecting lockout policies and random-number generators based on timestamps, and makes timestamps for data analysis unreliable. NOTE: the vendor reports that this is largely irrelevant because it only affects log-entry timestamps, and because the plant time would later be reset via NTP. (It has never been the case that a lockout policy or random-number generator was affected.) Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
      The function GfxImageColorMap::getGray in GfxState.cc in Poppler 0.54.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted PDF document, related to missing color-map validation in ImageOutputDev.cc.
      In Mosquitto through 1.4.12, mosquitto.db (aka the persistence file) is world readable, which allows local users to obtain sensitive MQTT topic information.
      The II_step_one function in layer2.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file.
