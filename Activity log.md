* Problem statement moved to wikki pages
* Renamed the project from THSM_SA to SMTI_SA
* Next steps: finding cyber security knowledge source, extracting entities

* Automatic Labeling for Entity Extraction in Cyber Security is presented in 2014 ASE Bigdata conference stanford university
* There are two problem statement in the paper, First, Auto labeling the sentence containing security related words and second part train the ML algorithm from the auto labeled NVD corpus to extract the security related from any given sentence
* Auto labeling is done by considering the each sentence and converting word list/vector s1={w1, w2, w3,...} and tags T={t1, t2, t3..} the probability of tag t1 applied to w1 is calculated using history based Maximum entropy method with greedy tagging algorithm.
* The auto labled corpus is used to train a classifier that can apply domain-appropriate labels to a wider class of documents including news articles, security blogs, and tweets.This is done by Mathew Honnibalâ€™s persuasive results and documentation of greedy tagging using the aver- aged perceptron for part-of-speech tagging
